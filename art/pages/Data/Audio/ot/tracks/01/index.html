        <p>Each human ( male or female ) have the same style in the "root" of their way of being the self.</p>
        <p>There are many who love to dance ( in many levels of interpretation of getting pleasure on what they like to do )</p>
        <p>and many others Love to watch, think and talk to their friends about it and see what happen.</p>
        <p>Probably a good moment to create instability or even to solve problems. Well, but because we are in a logic world</p>
        <p>we all pass through both experiences, in time...Sometimes we are Cats, and other times we are Dogs</p>
        <p>Maybe we cannot escape from being one or another, but at least we know why people love so much ( Cats and Dogs )</p>
