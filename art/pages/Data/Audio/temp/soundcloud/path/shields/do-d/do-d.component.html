  <p>The image of this track is funny</p>
  <p>That logo is from Department of Defense</p>
  <p>This is not nothing personal to try to offend them</p>
  <p>Glad I found their Logo Perfect to the Title of this track</p>
  <p>Yes, yes, sex is awesome and we should all live making sex</p>
  <p>but if people wish to have sex</p>
  <p>they already do it because they agree to do it</p>
  <p>Relations between people who have sex with each others</p>
  <p>Ask Respect of Will</p>
  <p>So in this Track, I am targeting those who dont give a fuck</p>
  <p>about what others care or see or want</p>
  <p>To those Deficients...</p>
  <p>who Rape children of both sex</p>
  <p>who Rape both sex not being children</p>
  <p>who use violence against someone to impose their Will of power</p>
  <p>Those who I am very Sure, are included in My Eternal License!!!</p>
