              <p>As You May Know, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solipsism" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Solipsism</a> is the
                "perfect" condition to be creative. Even when such theory deny others existence,
                which is false, because I am sure You exist, when we are alone doing creative work, we get less obstacles to
                produce it as we wish to.
                Individualism is not a choice, but a condition. A realtime condition to all of us. Naturally, we need others for
                many things in our lifes, but with or without someone, we talk only in the name
                of our own individual interpretation of something... Love, Reason, Fair, Faith, Friends, Pain, Art, Music,
                Literature, etc... We all express
                our opinion, based on our individual condition to learn and express what we had learn, which most is, what we had
                experienced,
                what was our individual choices, based on our individual memories. Always our own individual interpretation,
                always our own individual perspective,
                always our own individual belief's, always our own life experience. "True" is expressed in time, because the only
                true is our own individual
                perception of time, fragmented with our own individual time of perceptions and expressions, that built our own
                individual interpretation of true,
                in a perfect condition of severals other trues in relation within. From Buddhism to Christians, theist and
                atheist's and science,
                all without exclusion are living in a individual condition of learning in time of ( conscience of what their own
                individual condition create to explain reality ).
                So is not wrong to say everyone is living in a false true condition. ( Solipsism - Individualistic ), and that is
                why we have so many different expressions
                of many similar subjects or even by the same subject in cause. That is the main reason to accept humanity have
                intelligence! ( because is creative )
                That is a Awesome Skill to learn new perspectives. Is wrong to declare my point of view as the absolute True,
                but is not wrong to declare that my expression of true is absolute, because it accept errors as part of the true,
                which means,
                it accept everything that influence but is not part of. Well, most important of everything is to understand that
                true comes and goes in time.
                Truth is a description of precision, not an expression of reality, which when accurs, are in fact true, because
                are expressed in a time precision, with an description we cannot deny it exist.
                Based on this description, we all live in a solipsistic condition, and because of that, no one should impose
                their true to anyone else.
