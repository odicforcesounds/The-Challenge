        <p>This track have two interpretations, as both are part of the original expression!</p>
        <p>Odin Intercepted not only Hanuman Choice which is my choice, which means,</p>
        <p>the same expression I am making right now, can be done by someone in the best condition to be Odin.</p>
        <p>We are part of an illusions which cares about how much we care all illusions we should care.</p>
        <p>At the same time, because this text is part of my ( shamanic quest in real time )</p>
        <p>I am in a perfect condition to belive everything is true, because it is an illusion!</p>
        <p>Illusions are creative forms to express messages, while creativity sometimes become more than a tool which serves
          conditions.</p>
        <p>I like to use Logic, because All Fantasy is an Expression of Logic and All Logic is an Expression of Fantasy. </p>
        <p>The intellectual focus and will to create each "abstract" concept, which are "objects" and which are used with
          "functions"</p>
        <p>are illusions, in the concept of a brain which create anything from the will to create.</p>
        <p>Naturally, the ceptic or pure rational people, ignore and do not deal very well with many body signals</p>
        <p>that if have a brain, images will be created, as an expression of creativity that any brain have. That is
          Spiritual! (Care the Message) </p>
