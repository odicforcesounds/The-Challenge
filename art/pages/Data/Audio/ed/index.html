          <b>Eternal Delay</b> Visions are only related to few fragments of the main message, giving humanity the chance to
          pay attention of how important is this message, and assuming the risk of a pure delay to this mass visions, to
          get what they expect it. More than anything, spiritual life must be
          <a href="./tracks/01/index.html">respected</a>, in every life form that can have
          several interpretations of itself. Because for many years I was septic to spiritual life, and all other sensitive
          <a href="./tracks/02/index.html">fields</a>, gods visions make me
          <a href="./tracks/03/index.html">remember</a> why I was the chosen one, but
          at the same time, this respect message was to be
          <a href="./tracks/05/index.html">sent</a> to the organization who I was targeting, Boom
          Festival Official. Not only a real time test, this was the only way for them, to accept their peaceful message in
          the name of their visions and in the name of human conscience of <a href="./tracks/04/index.html">Divine Respect</a>, aims to gain world wide peace, without Odin touch, as he gave a
          possible solution to fix some human problems related to Nature care, Animal care and Human care, with a simple <b>social
            game</b> called WorldCleaner, that will be a reality very soon. Because they believe that humanity shouldnâ€™t
          get
          <a href="./tracks/09/index.html">mad</a>, they chose me to be a kind of human
          <a href="./tracks/10/index.html">conscience</a> Messenger.
          Most of all, they need to
          understand if you really wish to care nature, as many of you say, because reality is
          <a href="./tracks/06/index.html">swimming into darkness</a> for too
          long, and this warning message could only come up from
          darkness.
          <a href="./tracks/11/index.html">Nothing need to change</a>!</p>
