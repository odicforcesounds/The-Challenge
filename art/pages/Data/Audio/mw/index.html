              This album is in fact a description of reality in the way of describing the human abstract wills and desires, to upgrade knowledge and to use technology for their own progress. In the shadows, there was a
        <a href="./tracks/01/index.html">Storming Plan</a> to reclaim War, because this reality was draining human’s time and true pleasure, the simplicity of living Free.
        Humanity was more and more concentrated in cities, and human laws ask
        <a href="./tracks/03/index.html">control</a> to all of them.
        They live for business and pleasures mostly at night, where all the interactions were close to any
        <a href="./tracks/07/index.html">jungle</a>. in any forest.
        Listening groovy music in a strange way, vibrations could be
        <a href="./tracks/10/index.html">noisy</a>
        and they were putting their life’s, between
        <a href="./tracks/05/index.html">
          Panic and Luck</a> In form of Art and Expression, they represent
          <a href="./tracks/02/index.html">pain</a>
          in many ways and in different forms using different sources, to
          <a href="./tracks/09/index.html">break</a>
          their personal noise, so they could
          <a href="./tracks/04/index.html">clean</a> their soul like a
          <a href="./tracks/06/index.html">thunder</a>.
          and finally understand that nothing
            was wrong with them, because it was only a way to express them self’s. <br></p>
