            <p>Nature (made to help us) to understand its simplicity</p>
            <p>Nature (made to help us) to understand its complexity</p>
            <p>Simplicity have many fragments of complexity</p>
            <p>and complexity have many fragments of simplicity</p>
            <p>In both sides of its natural Expression!</p>
            <p>It is no more than an expression of Nature!</p>
            <p>Like I am...</p>
            <p>I dont see any problems with any kind of drugs</p>
            <p>I will tell you why, but remember I use Logic.</p>
            <p>People like to enjoy body experiences</p>
            <p>People who take drugs, normally read already about the effects</p>
            <p>Normally they understand chemistry, they study and use their brain</p>
            <p>They understand the body and do it with more people who have experience or conscience</p>
            <p>Taking Drugs dont put others in risk ( is most cases is true sometimes does )</p>
            <p>If there is no conscience of the one who take drugs</p>
            <p>But, drugs are everywhere</p>
            <p>Because even Coffee or Tea or Tabaco or Sugar are Drugs</p>
            <p>Should I talk about psy pharma ( Drugs to stop the Brain activity, not to "cure" )</p>
            <p>Cure others in the sense of mind, is educating other on how to use the mind.</p>
            <p>I dont really accept this (anti drug legal movements)</p>
            <p>Since by experience and Life history in societies did result in the same...</p>
            <p>Alcohol had the same results we are gettings this days with other kind of drugs</p>
            <p>Alcohol was forbidden, violence to have alcohol commercialized happen</p>
            <p>gangsters and many other kind of violent groups</p>
            <p>that I believe they disappear if there is nothing agaist their choices</p>
            <p>Their free choice to consume and do nothing with their bodies</p>
            <p>Because We all have to gain money to dream as a condition to live</p>
            <p>Even if we didnt use any kind of money, exchange of goods happen always</p>
            <p>Even Love is a Business, with or without Money! ( You have an agreenment )</p>
            <p>...</p>
            <p>I am agains those who impose their will of power to gain power of Will</p>
            <p>which means, using drugs with a girl to make sex with her</p>
            <p>but I am not against someone who just take drugs and do stupid things</p>
            <p>but doesnt disturm anyone, doesnt create instability, doesnt create troubles</p>
            <p>Marijuana or Pot or Cannabis are made to give to the consumer a sense of being calm</p>
            <p>LSD give visual allucinations (going to a movie that is designed for You and by You)</p>
            <p>All those experiences</p>
            <p>Give an opportunity to gain higher conscience and more accurate perceptions of reality</p>
            <p>Open ( the resonance channel )</p>
            <p>the electromagnetic fields become more sensible</p>
            <p>Then, sometimes, it give an idea of having telepathic communications</p>
            <p>if people have that skill already</p>
            <p>which in many cases ( it was communication )</p>
            <p>Because We do communicate without talking!!! ( with or withou drugs )</p>
            <p>...</p>
            <p>I believe that any drug can be and give an expression of nature</p>
            <p>but I can only accept that Guns or Bombs are an expression of Nature</p>
            <p>If we are not Conscience about our own choices</p>
            <p>Because, Nature didnt create more tools to kill</p>
            <p>It gives tools to those animals that depend on that tool</p>
            <p>As they born with those tools in their body!!!</p>
