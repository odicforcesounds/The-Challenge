            <p>Sadly but true. For any kind of community we need organization, which include many levels of disciplines.</p>
            <p>Disciplines come in a condition of "there is no escape" or "there is no other way to deal with".</p>
            <p>Well, while Order create Disorder, Disorder Create Condition of Order.</p>
            <p>Make Your Choices, Wisely!</p>
            <p>Even when both order and disorder are part of the same expression of organization</p>
            <p>I do not like the concept of order or disorder... </p>
            <p>Remembers me choices...</p>
            <p>I do not like to make choices...</p>
            <p>I like disorder because disorder have expressions that dance in form of art...</p>
            <p>While life is disorder... </p>
            <p>But even disorder have order...</p>
            <p>While order do not give conditions of freedom and will or expression</p>
            <p>Disorder accept all kind of expressions as a free will condition of the disorder it self</p>
            <p>Accepting simplicity of each intentional will to learn about him/her self.</p>
            <p>A naural behave of any living being testing reality...</p>
            <p>Being crazy in sense of those who judge, because we talk alone or sing</p>
            <p>is Freedom!</p>
            <p>I see order in disorder, because I accept irregularity and metamorphosis in everything</p>
            <p>I do not really care about each fragment of each singular expression of life or interpretation</p>
            <p>As I am at the same time, the same...</p>
            <p>I accept disorder because I am in a perfect order of disorder</p>
            <p>My Life Experience... in Body... with Brain...</p>
            <p>All connected to the experience of their dance of Love</p>
            <p>I call it Spiritual...</p>
            <p>Can You give me permition to simplify this simple complexity called reality?</p>
            <p>Well, more than thinking, doing... </p>
            <p>since illusions are in our brain to give us the opportunity to refuse them or build them!</p>
            <p>remmebers me the Matrix...where the problem is choice!</p>
            <p>So this is very simple</p>
            <p>Society express the problem</p>
            <p>In a conditional living state of my existence, made in a random intention</p>
            <p>which society did create</p>
            <p>I create a solution so You can make choices.</p>
            <p>My choice was to express it, not to create it!</p>
            <p>But at the same time I do wish to create, I am building it!</p>
            <p>It is controversial in fact... </p>
            <p>but that is the bridge I like most, between Order and Disorder!</p>
            <p>If Society creates Disorder it is logic that a new order need to be expressed </p>
            <p>Life is like that</p>
            <p>metamorphosis </p>
            <p>( that is accepting simplicity )</p>
            <br><br>
            <p>Maybe this message that is spiritual, which logicly is political</p>
            <p>ShAll be Cared</p>
