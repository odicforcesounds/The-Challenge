          <p>Here is the pratical and scientific method to create illusions</p>
          <p>Spirituality is made using the same concepts and have the same levels of wills (at least)</p>
          <p>Naturally, coding an illusions is "esier" then building an illusions</p>
          <p>while together can be perfect to give continuity to both illusional paths</p>
          <p>since both use logic!</p>
          <p>since both use structures</p>
          <p>since both use probability</p>
          <p>Do You know developers who never made a mistake?</p>
          <p>Do You think?</p>
          <p>Maybe that is a mistake...</p>
          <p>But keep doing mistakes...</p>
          <p>The debug message may help you to do less mistakes...</p>
          <p>so You learn...</p>
          <p>Maybe you shouldn learn anything...</p>
          <p>if you not desire to change your own simplicity...</p>
          <p>if you accept your own illusions as simple illusions...</p>
          <p>that come and go...</p>
          <p>like the water of any river </p>
          <p>then dont learn...</p>
          <p>do not change anything...</p>
          <p>just live...</p>
          <p>in peace...</p>
          <p>while you should pay attention to your illusions</p>
          <p>Since they are part of reality!</p>
          <p>and if we care to gain peace in our own illusional path</p>
          <p>may we care to gain peace in others illusional path as well</p>
