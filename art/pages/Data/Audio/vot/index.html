        The first album is in fact about <span style="color:orange">Thor</span>, the one who have the first vision of what was really happening.
        As <span style="color:orange">Thor</span> was who was sending light, he is the first one who see.
        He saw <span style="color:yellow">Buddha</span> falling and he listen <span style="color:greenyellow">Shiva</span> words (<span style="color:aqua">Out of Compassion for Me, don’t Destroy my Gifts</span>)
        which is represented as a
        <a routerLink="/pain/vs/love" routerLinkActive="active">Love and Pain</a> letter between <span style="color:yellow">Buddha</span> and <span style="color:greenyellow">Shiva</span> with the title “
        <a routerLink="/burned/in/the/hands/of/wind" routerLinkActive="active">Burned in the Hands of Wind - Noisy Silence</a>“.
        Because I am the one who get <span style="color:greenyellow">Shiva</span> information’s about many things related to this story,
        I had the need to be included not only as gods voice, but as a single human too, telling the world that “
        <a routerLink="/we/are/the/ones" routerLinkActive="active">We are the Ones</a>“, and all information sent by <span style="color:greenyellow">Shiva</span> itself in form of signals vibrations, are related to his
        <a routerLink="/shake/my/snakes" routerLinkActive="active">Snakes</a>.
        The key to understand <span style="color:greenyellow">Shiva</span> signals was in a
        <a routerLink="/invisible/frequency/you/can/change" routerLinkActive="active">Invisible Frequency</a>, that represent a must change, my own change, my own behavior, giving me an constant
        <a routerLink="/emerge/internal/upgrade" routerLinkActive="active">Internal Spiritual Upgrade</a>, to have a method to detect where was the <span style="color:red">Evil</span> in this reality.
        The main mission was to target the
        <a routerLink="/v/euclidean/space" routerLinkActive="active">World</a>, so all could pay attention to human care key solution, that is inside of the will of Love and <a routerLink="/summer/night/rock/and/roll" routerLinkActive="active">Freedom</a>, by loving
        <a routerLink="/water/horses/woman/free" routerLinkActive="active">someone</a>, and Save Water, which is the key to human Life.
