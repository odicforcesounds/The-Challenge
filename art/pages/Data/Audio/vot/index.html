            The first album is in fact about <span style="color:orange">Thor</span>, the one who have the first vision of what was really happening.
            As <span style="color:orange">Thor</span> was who was sending light, he is the first one who see.
            He saw <span style="color:yellow">Buddha</span> falling and he listen <span style="color:greenyellow">Shiva</span> words (<span style="color:aqua">Out of Compassion for Me, don’t Destroy my Gifts</span>)
            which is represented as a
            <a href="./tracks/03/index.html">Love and Pain</a> letter between <span style="color:yellow">Buddha</span> and <span style="color:greenyellow">Shiva</span> with the title “
            <a href="./tracks/05/index.html">Burned in the Hands of Wind - Noisy Silence</a>“.
            Because I am the one who get <span style="color:greenyellow">Shiva</span> information’s about many things related to this story,
            I had the need to be included not only as gods voice, but as a single human too, telling the world that “
            <a href="./tracks/11/index.html">We are the Ones</a>“, and all information sent by <span style="color:greenyellow">Shiva</span> itself in form of signals vibrations, are related to his
            <a href="./tracks/10/index.html">Snakes</a>.
            The key to understand <span style="color:greenyellow">Shiva</span> signals was in a
            <a href="./tracks/08/index.html">Invisible Frequency</a>, that represent a must change, my own change, my own behavior, giving me an constant
            <a href="./tracks/01/index.html">Internal Spiritual Upgrade</a>, to have a method to detect where was the <span style="color:red">Evil</span> in this reality.
            The main mission was to target the
            <a href="./tracks/06/index.html">World</a>, so all could pay attention to human care key solution, that is inside of the will of Love and 
            <a href="./tracks/04/index.html">Freedom</a>, by loving
            <a href="./tracks/02/index.html">someone</a>, and Save Water, which is the key to human Life.
