<B>Flanders</B> (Vlaanderen in Flemish, Flandre in French) is historically significant for a number of reasons.  Perhaps the most important reason, in the long run, was that it became the site of the first major development of commercial culture in Northern Europe.  By the 13th century, the largest cities in <a href="francia.htm">Francia</a> north of the Alps were, with Paris and London, <B>Ghent</B> (Gent or Gand) and <B>Bruges</B> (Brugge, German Br&uuml;gge -- preserving much of its Mediaeval look even today), which led northern Europe in the development of trade and manufacture.  Since nothing of the sort had happened there under the Romans, it gives us a milestone in the emergence of Europe from under the Roman shadow, and from the economic nadir of the Dark Ages.  This economic development and power is what made Burgundy under its <a href="#philip2">Valois Dukes</a> a Great Power in the 15th Century -- by the end of which, i.e. in the Renaissance, development had spread to the nearby cities of Antwerp (Antwerpen, Anvers), Brussels (Bruxelles, Br&uuml;ssel), and Lille.  By then a few German cities had become significant, like Cologne, Lubeck, and Nuremberg; but the economic centers of Francia were definitely in what would later be Belgium and, the real powerhouse, the North of Italy.

<P>Another reason for the significance of Flanders, of less significance in the long run but rather spectacular (if sordid) at the time, was that a Count of Flanders, Baldwin IX, was installed by the Fourth Crusade as the <a href="romania.htm#latins">Roman Emperor</a> in Constantinople.  This turned out to be a brief and miserable business -- Baldwin himself was soon captured in battle with the Bulgarians, dying while a prisoner -- but it was certainly a long way to come just from being Count of Flanders.  Finally, Flanders passed by marriage first to the Dukes of Burgundy and then to the Hapsburgs.

<P>Because of the inheritance of the Hapsburgs, Flanders ended up, uniquely, as the only territory that began Middle Ages as part of France but ended them, as it still is, alienated from France.  This was not for want of French efforts.  In 1701, Louis XIV had effectively occupied all of the Spanish Netherlands, including Flanders.  The decisive moment, however, came with the Battle of Ramillies in 1706, when John Churchill, the 1st <a href="#marl">Duke of Marlborough</a>, completely destroyed a French army and was then able to overrun Flanders, which thus passed to Austria.  Except during the French Revolution, France never had a realistic chance of recovering the territory.  Today, most of historical Flanders, except for Picardy, is part of <a href="lorraine.htm#belgium">Belgium</a>, the successor of the Spanish and Austrian Netherlands.
<br clear=right>

<P>The County of Flanders begins with a bit of romance.  Judith, daughter of the Emperor <a href="francia.htm#bald">Charles the Bald</a>, was married off twice to English Kings; but she returned and eloped with Baldwin Iron Arm.  Charles disapproved, but Judith could not be induced to forsake him.  So Charles relented and granted Flanders to the two of them.  At first a "march county" (Margravate), Flanders soon reverted to a simple county.

The succession becomes a little confusing with the children of Baldwin V.  Baldwin's grandson Arnulf III seems to have been murdered by his uncle, Robert I; but then the main line of succession from Robert I dies out, and the County passes to Charles the Good, grandson of Robert through his daughter Adele, who had married <a href="perifran.htm#scandinavia">Canute IV</a> the Holy of Denmark and went on to marry <a href="italia.htm#sicily">Roger Borsa</a>, Duke of Apulia, and become of the mother of William, Duke of Apulia.  Charles the Good, in turn, is murdered himself, and the County passes to a second cousin, William Clito of Normandy, the great grandson of Baldwin V through his daughter Maltilda, who had married William the Bastard, later <a href="#conqueror">William the Conqueror</a>, of Normandy.

The Norman doesn't</a> last long (killed at the battle of Axspoele, 1128), and the succession passes to another grandson of Robert I, through his daughter Gertrude, who had married Dietrich II, Duke of Lorraine.  Gertrude's son was also named Dietrich, but his name turns up in various other languages, as Thierry (French), Dirk or Didrik (Dutch or Flemish), and even Terry (English).  Curiously, it is ultimately a cognate of <I>Thiudareiks</I> or "King of the People" in Gothic.  This is more familiar in its rendering as "Theodoric," the name of the greatest King of the <a href="germania.htm#ostrogoths">Ostrogoths</a>.  The House of Alsace flourishes in Flanders under Dietrich and his son and daughter, Philip of Alsace and Margareta.

<P>Two flags for Flanders are associated with Philip of Alsace.  Preparing to go on the Third Crusade in 1188, Philip agreed with <img src="history/flanders.gif" align=left>Richard of England and Philip Augustus of France that knights of Flanders would wear a green cross on white.  Philip, however, already was using arms that became characteristic of Flanders, a black lion on a gold field -- <I>Vlaenderen die Leu</I>, "Flanders the Lion."  <img src="history/flander9.gif" align=right>There are different versions of the origin of this.  The traditional story is that it was seized from the Muslims while Philip was on the Second Crusade in 1177.  However, a seal of Philip exists from 1162, antedating the Crusade, showing the lion already.  It may have been adopted from William of Ypres, who was using it in 1158.  See <a href="http://flagspot.net/flags/be-vlg.html">Flags of the World</a> for more details.

<P>It is the sons of Margareta and her husband (and cousin), Baldwin of Hainault, who embarked on the Fourth Crusade and ended up in Constantinople.  The feudal division of Romania and successes by the <a href="romania.htm#asens">Bulgarians</a> and Greeks of <a href="romania.htm#lascar">Nicaea</a> and <a href="romania.htm#epirus">Epirus</a> soon reduced their position to impotence, and neither started a line in Constantinople.  However, the throne fell to their sister Yolanda, who had married a grandson of Louis VI of France, Peter de Courtenay.  Neither Peter nor Yolanda lasted long, but their sons, Robert and Baldwin, were more durable.  Indeed, Baldwin's reign comprised half the entire history of the Latin Empire at Constantinople.  It was Baldwin who was finally driven out by the Greeks in 1261.  His granddaughter Catharine married Charles of Valois of France, son of Philip III.  Had she had a son, she could have then been the mother of the Valois House of French Kings.  As it was, her daughter, called Catherine of Valois, who could not succeed to the throne of France because of the Salic Law, became the Latin Imperial Pretender and also Princess of Achaia.  Meanwhile, Flanders had been left to the daughters of Baldwin IX, Joanna and Margaret, both of whom enjoyed long reigns.  Joanna's first husband, Ferrand, son of King Sancho I of Portugal, was captured by King <a href="francia.htm#capet">Philip II</a> of France in the defeat of Emperor <a href="francia.htm#swabia">Otto IV</a> at the battle of Bouvines in 1214.

<br clear=right>

<br>Joanna failed to leave an heir, but Margaret did -- in fact two, one for <a href="lorraine.htm#hainaut">Hainault</a> (from her first husband, Burchard of Avesnes) and one for Flanders (from her second husband, Guy of Dampierre).  <img src="history/flander3.gif" align=right>Much of the subsequent history of the house is then consumed with conflicts between, on the one side, France and England in the Hundred Years War, and, on the other side, the newly prosperous Flemish burgers, who were ready and able to overthrown feudalism and establish their own commercial republic.<br clear=left>

<P><a name="revolt">The power of the burgers was revealed in 1302, when the citizens of Bruges massacred the French garrison and then defeated (and massacred again) the French army sent against them.  The former event is the Matins of Bruges, while the latter was the Battle of the Golden Spurs -- after the trophies stripped from the dead French knights.  As with the <a href="francia.htm#swiss">Swiss</a>, these events demonstrated the power of a disciplined citizen army against feudal cavalry.  For a while, a commercial republic was actually established, under the rule of Jacob van Artevalde, the "Brewer of Ghent," 1337-1345; but Artevalde was killed by his own people, and eventually the tide of war turned for the French against Flanders, even when the English were winning.  Count Louis I was killed fighting for the French King <a href="francia.htm#valois">Philip VI</a> at the battle Cr&eacute;cy, the great victory of <a href="perifran.htm#england">Edward III</a> of England, in 1346.  The power of the Counts was ground down between the French King and the burgers.  The independent line of the Counts of Flanders came to an end with Margaret of M&acirc;le.  Margaret was first betrothed to Philip of Rouvre, Duke of Burgundy.  Philip, however, died of the Plague in 1361, bringing the Capetian line of Dukes of Burgundy to an end.  Margaret then married Philip the Bold, who became the first Valois Duke of <a href="#philip2">Burgundy</a> in 1364, as his brother succeeded to the throne of France as Charles V.  Thus, the fortunes of Flanders pass into the House of Burgundy and ultimately to the Hapsburgs.

<P>Today the phrase "Flanders' fields" conjures visions of the slaughter of battles in World War I, like Ypres, that occurred there.  This unfortunately continued the long history of the area as a battlefield, as at the great battle of <a href="#marl">Oudenaarde</a> in 1708.  Today, free of French Marshalls and German panzers, the land is happily a peaceful and prosperous one.<br clear=right>

<P>The project of reproducing lists and genealogies of rulers in these pages began when I found the succession of the Counts of Flanders given in <I>Kingdoms of Europe</I>, by Gene Gurney [Crown Publishers, New York, 1982].  I had never come across anything like that before and found it very intriguing.  But it was not the easiest thing to track down better information.  Some mistakes and gaps in Gurney I was able to correct by consulting the <I>Histoire de Flandre et des Flamands au Moyen Age</I> by Edward Le Glay [Imprimateurs des Facult&eacute;s Catholiques de Lille, 1886] and <I>The Murder of Charles the Good -- Galbert of Bruges</I>, translated & edited by James Bruce Ross [University of Toronto Press, 1982].  Now, internet sources, like Brian Tompsett's Royal and Noble genealogy, cover this material.

The County of Artois lay between the Counties of <a href="#">Flanders</a> and <a href="francia.htm#vermandois">Vermandois</a>, fronting on the English Channel.

<br><img src="images/maps/artois.gif"><br>

Louis VIII of France granted Artois to his son Robert, just as he granted Anjou to Charles (who became <a href="italia.htm#anjou-2">King of Naples and Sicily</a>) and Portiers to Alphonse (who then also become Count of <a href="#toulouse">Toulouse</a>).  His eldest son, of course, became St. Louis IX of <a href="francia.htm#capet">France</a>.

<P>While Artois was not about to become a player, let alone a power, and Robert failed to snag the larger domains that his brothers did, his descendants nevertheless intermarried into the house of <a href="perifran.htm#navarre">Narvarre</a>, the <a href="lorraine.htm#franchecomte">Free County</a> of Burgundy, the Duchy of <a href="#burgundy">Burgundy</a>, <a href="#">Flanders</a>, and, twice, Kings of France.  The County ended up in the inheritance of Flanders and finally of the Valois Dukes of Burgundy.  It passed to the <a href="francia.htm#hapsburg">Hapsburg</a> heirs of Burgundy but was recovered by Louis XIV in 1659 in the Peace of the Pyrennes, which finally ended the Thirty Years War with Spain (which thus actually had been a 41 years war).  The infamous "Flanders' fields" of World War I were, as often as not, actually in Artois.

<P>The genealogy here is a brief run and often simply connects lines found in other tables, as linked.  I have now included it because a list of Counts is given in the <I>Oxford Dynasties of the World</I> by John E. Morby [Oxford University Press, 1989, 2002, p.94].  The genealogical details have been supplied from the <I>Erz&auml;hlende genealogische Stammtafeln zur europ&auml;ischen Geschichte</I>, Volume II, Part 1, <I>Europ&auml;iche Kaiser-, K&ouml;nigs- und F&uuml;rstenh&auml;user</I> I <I>Westeuropa</I> [Andreas Thiele, R.

Brittany takes its name from the <a href="scotia.htm#celtic">Celtic</a> refugees who fled Britain, mainly Cornwall, <img src="history/brittany.gif" align=right>during the German invasions of the 5th century.  The Roman name of the Brittany peninsula had been "Armorica."  There was also a tradition that Celtic soldiers had stayed in the region after crossing over from Britain with the usurper <a href="romania.htm#valentin">Magnus Maximus</a> in 383.  Their leader in 388 was said to be "Cynan [or Conan] Meriadoc."  The same name occurs in the first more-or-less historical ruler of Brittany around 450.  Following this later Cynan Meriadoc is a continuous list of local kings, as in <a href="perifran.htm#england">Ireland and Britain</a>, until the first ruler, Frodaldus, for whom there are more than just vague and conjectural dates.

<P>Readers of J.R.R. Tolkien's <a href="ents.htm"><I>Lord of the Rings</I></a> triology who study Breton history will notice that, as with Anglo-Saxon and Norse literature, Tolkien took some names, like Meriadoc and Rohan, from Brittany.  Otherwise, thanks to its era and origin, Brittany figures in Arthurian stories.  "Conan," of course was borrowed into other fantasy literature.

<P>In the early mediaeval period, Brittany was usually all but independent under its own Kings and Dukes.  Both titles, sometimes used simultaneously or interchangeably, related to Brittany's ethnic and independent nature, where "Duke," <I>Dux</I>, was the Latin title, derived from a Roman frontier military commander, that tended to settle on ethnic rulers of substantial domains within the larger Germano-Roman successor states.  Thus, Basque Dukes ruled <a href="#gascony">Gascony</a>, and, most importantly, the tribal lands of Germany developed into the <a href="germany.htm">Stem Duchies</a>, around which German history would revolve for some centuries.  In its practical independence, Brittany is often not even shown as belonging to the Empire of <a href="francia.htm#caroling">Charlemagne</a>.

<P>Breton independence began to erode largely thanks to <a href="germania.htm#norse">Viking</a> raids and occupation.  Raids began in 836, and in 843 Nantes, the capital at the mouth of the Loire, was attacked for the first time.  At the death of Saloman III the country was largely overrun for ten years.  Alain I held things together again, but then in 911 <a href="#norman">Normandy</a> was ceded to Rollo, who took a dim view of Viking brethren raiding his new Norman domain.  The raiders moved west, and Brittany came under heightened attack.  The defenses collapsed, Breton nobility fled to England and Francia, and Vikings occupied Nantes in 919.  Their leader I find variously identified as Rognvald and William Longsword.  They made no particular attempt to organize their rule as Rollo was doing in Normandy.  After a revolt, Alain Barbetorte returned from England and landed with an army in 936.  He defeated the Vikings and expelled them from the country by 939.  However, the damage had been done.  Breton independence had been fatally compromised, and the Duchy drifted under the influence of Normandy.

<P>As often happened in the Middle Ages, Brittany became a pawn to larger forces when the Duchy fell to an heiress, Constance.  Her marriage would determined the fate of the domain.  With King Henry II of <a href="perifran.htm#plant">England</a> dominating northern and western France, his son Geoffrey was married to Constance.  Their son Arthur succeeded to the Duchy but was murdered by his uncle, King John, to eliminate his claim to the English Throne.  The Pope put England under an interdict for this crime.  The next heiress, Alice, was the daughter of Constance by her third marriage.  Her marriage led to the house of Dreux ruling the Duchy from 1213, with a brief interlude, the War of the Breton Succession, between 1341-1364, when Charles of <a href="#champ">Blois</a> was Duke.

<P><center><img src="history/britany2.gif"></center>

<P>The ultimate fate of Brittany was a matter of the marriages other heiresses.  The Duchess Anne, the eighth generation after her namesake, married both King Charles VIII and King Louis XII of <a href="francia.htm#orleans">France</a>.  The agreement was that Brittany would be enfeoffed to a younger son or an elder daughter, which had been the practice of the French Throne with such large peripheral domains (especially and disastrously with <a href="#burgundy">Burgundy</a>).  There were no surviving sons from either marriage, but her daughter Claudia (by Louis XII) then married her second cousin King Francis I, who, after her death, simply annexed the Duchy to the Royal domain.  The French Kings now thought better of dividing up the Kingdom between brothers, and with a growing modern economy, they now had the money for soldiers and administrators who made such divisions -- and all of feudalism -- unnecessary.

<P><center><img src="images/maps/france-d.gif"></center>

<P><img src="history/brittany.gif" align=right>Today the Breton language is the last Celtic language spoken on the mainland of Europe (though not originating there), and Breton separatism is still a thorn in the side of French politics.  Regional languages are not given much toleration, let alone promotion, in French education.  And so in the absence of strong agitation, Breton may be doomed.  The flag, with its distinctive motif, is modern.  And, yes, its colors are simply black and white.

<P>The earliest rulers of Brittany, from its legendary origin, are given in <I>The Mammoth Book of British Kings & Queens</I>, by Mike Ashley [Carroll & Graf Publishers, Inc., New York, 1999, pp.727-729].  Later Dukes as given here, beginning with Frodaldus, were originally assembled from Brian Tompsett's Royal and Noble genealogy and the <I>The Mammoth Book of British Kings & Queens</I>.  Now the genealogy is principally from the <I>Erz&auml;hlende genealogische Stammtafeln zur europ&auml;ischen Geschichte</I>, Volume II, Part 1, <I>Europ&auml;iche Kaiser-, K&ouml;nigs- und F&uuml;rstenh&auml;user I Westeuropa</I> [Andreas Thiele, R. G. Fischer Verlag, Part 1, Third Edition, 2001, pp.123-130].  Some variation exists in the numbering of the rulers.  Numbers for names like Ho&euml;l and Alain frequently start over with the fully historical dukes (as here with Alain).  The data on the Viking raids and occupation is from <I>The Penguin Historical Atlas of the Vikings</I>, by John Haywood, "The Vikings in Brittany" [Penguin, 1995, pp.82-83].  The brief historical notes in <I>The Mammoth Book</I> do not match up real well with the narrative of <I>The Penguin Atlas</I>.<br clear=left>

<P><img src="images/maps/burgundy.gif" align=right>The Duchy of Burgundy began in 880 when part of the Kingdom of Burgundy was detached and assigned to France (West Francia).  This was part of the Treaty of Ribemont by which the young West Frankish Kings, Louis III and Carloman II, were deprived of most of Lorraine.  Or this may have already happened with the Treaty of Verdun in 843.  The first Duke, however, was Richard the Justicer (or Justiciar) of Autun in 880.  <img src="history/burgundy.gif" align=left>Robert I was the first Capetian Duke of Burgundy, founding a line that lasted until 1361.  The next line, the Valois Dukes, starting with Philip the Bold, ushered in the classic era of Burgundian power.  Marrying Margaret, the heiress of <a href="#">Flanders</a>, Philip began a process of adding, by marriage and conquest, to the Burgundian domain, expanding it into a rival to the throne of France itself.  This process ended abruptly in 1477 with the death in battle of Charles the Bold, but it then became part of the process of Hapsburg expansion when Charles's daughter Mary wedded the future Emperor Maximilian.  The Duchy of Burgundy itself passed to the French Throne in that transition, but most of the rest of the Burgundian domain became a long term addition to the House of Hapsburg.  The Court of Mary and Maximilian was one of the jewels of the Renaissance; and the Burgundian knotty ("raguly") Cross ("saltire") of St. Andrew became a feature of flags in the Low Countries and later of Hapsburg Spain.<br clear=right>

At the beginning, the Duchy of Burgundy seems closely associated with the French throne, at one point with the Duke himself (Rudolf) becoming King of France.  After two different brothers of Hugh Capet are Dukes, a durable line is established by Robert I, brother of King Henry I.  This line of Capetian Dukes lasts over three hundred years, for most of which it seems a relatively minor player in the history of France or of Europe.  One notable exception is the fortune of Henry, son of Robert I, who acquires a county in <a href="perifran.htm#burgundy">Spain</a>, marrying an illegitimate daughter of Alfonso VI of Le&oacute;n and Castile.  This is Portugal, and it becomes a Kingdom under Henry's son, Afonso I.  Over time, important Burgundian territories, like Nevers, Macon, and Langres, became alienated, in classic feudal fashion, from the Duchy.

<P>In the last days of the line, things were in the works to reverse the tendency of alienation and greatly expand the domain of the Dukes.  Eudes IV married the heiress, Jeanne, of the <a href="lorraine.htm#franchecomte">Free County</a> of Burgundy, and then his grandson Philip was preparing to marry the heiress, Margaret, of the County of <a href="#">Flanders</a>.  Philip, however, died of the plague before the marriage could be effected.  This setback, however, only delayed the project.  While the Duchy reverted to the French Throne, the Free County passed by separate inheritance to the Countess Margaret herself, who then married the new Valois Duke of Burgundy, Philip the Bold.<br clear=right>

The Valois Dukes of Burgundy take the Duchy from the status of a relative backwater to a central place in European politics, and culture.  This got off to a fast start as Margaret of M&acirc;le brought with her Flanders and the Free County of Burgundy.  Flanders was one of the most prosperous places in Europe, giving the Duke a major source of revenue, and the Free County gave him a foothold in the Empire and in the old Kingdom of Burgundy.

<P><img src="history/burgodk2.gif" align=right>It became a goal of the Dukes to be recognized as King of <a href="francia.htm#kingdom">Burgundy</a> by the Emperor, although most Burgundian acquisitions were in the historic Duchies of Lorraine (Upper and Lower).

<P>The proximity of Flanders to England also put the Dukes in a position as active allies of England in the Hundred Years War (1337-1453), which is why they were the ones to arrest Joan of Arc.

<P>After initial acquisitions by marriage, the Dukes move on to more forceful means.  As a grandson of Count Albert of Holland and Hainault, the Duke Philip the Good pushed aside the proper heiress, Jacqueline of <a href="lorraine.htm#holland">Holland</a>.  The claim was even more tenuous for other territories, like <a href="lorraine.htm#luxemold">Luxemburg</a>.<br clear=right>

<P>This increasing resort to force, however, came to a bad end.  As Charles the Bold tried to effect the Burgundian conquest of Lorraine, under its Duke <a href="lorraine.htm#nancy">Ren&eacute; II</a>, he was defeated and killed in the Battle of Nancy in 1477.  This was a battle that counted as one of the first modern battles, since it was won by an infantry of Swiss pikemen, i.e. commoners defeating mounted knights -- forces just hired by Ren&eacute; in Switzerland.

</table>

We see the death of Charles in the battle on the epic canvas of Delacroix.

<P>The project of Burgundian aggrandizement, although here again suffering a considerable setback, and the loss of the Duchy itself to the French Throne (it could not be inherited by the heiress of Burgundy, Mary, under the Salic Law), again only experienced a kind of delay.  The fortunes of Mary now became attached to her husband, Maximilian of Hapsburg, soon to be elected Emperor.

<P>Maximilian, who moved to live with Mary in the Netherlands, and presided over a brilliant Renaissance Court, held the Hapsburg lands of Austria, and then their son Philip married the heiress Joanna (Juana) of Spain.  <img src="history/burgundy.gif" align=left>The Burgundian ambitions, after a fashion, and with the symbol of the Cross of Burgundy then found on even Spanish uniforms, thus culminated in Mary and Maximilian's grandson, the Emperor Charles V, to whom the Free County, most of Lower Lorraine (i.e. the Netherlands), Austria, Spain, Naples, Sicily, and Spanish possessions in the New World all passed, enabling him to dominate the age and become the arbiter, if not exactly the hegemon, of Europe.  His power was challenged at one's peril, as the Pope and the King of France both learned.

<P>Meanwhile, the Duchy of Burgundy, reverting to the King of France, was never again to be enfeoffed elsewhere.  Today its name may be the most familiarly associated with the characteristic dark red wine of the region.  Similarly, the capital, Dijon, has become a famous name in mustard.  The Kingdom of <a href="francia.htm#media-B">Burgundy</a>, which the Dukes sought to revive, has disappeared from both maps and memory.<br clear=left>

<H2 ALIGN="center">Counts & Dukes of Nevers, 887-1708 AD</H2>

<P><center><img src="images/key.gif"></center>

<P><img src="history/nevers.gif" align=left>Nevers was a feudatory of the Duchy of <a href="#burgundy">Burgundy</a>, at the West end of the domain, as can be seen on the map below.  The city of Nevers was actually on the Loire River, which we would think of as very much in the center of modern France.  The fief began to be bestowed on vassals from an early date, initially by the Capetian Duke Otto-Henry, who was actually a brother of Hugh Capet, the King of <a href="francia.htm#capet">France</a>.  Nevers was usually a package with the County of Auxerre, along with some other fiefs, although at times these could also be separated.  As we can see, Otto-Henry begins by favoring his wife's son, Count Otto William of the <a href="lorraine.htm#franchecomte">Free County</a> of Burgundy, which was itself a feudatory of the Kingdom of <a href="francia.htm#media-B">Burgundy</a>, not of France at all.  Otto William seems to have had his finger in a lot of pies, and he was himself briefly the Duke of Burgundy.  Subsequent Counts of Nevers are all descendants of Otto William.

<P><center><img src="images/maps/burgund2.gif"></center>

<P>Before long, the initial line of descent ends with an heiress, Matilda, who marries Landerich (or Landri) of Monseau.  Henceforth the succession is untroubled for six generations, until we begin to get one heiress after another, in fact six successive generations of them.  This is unusual enough that on the chart below I have identified and numbered the heiresses.  This number is only beat, in my experience, by <a href="perifran.htm#navarre">Navarre</a>, which, over a longer period, had <a href="perifran.htm#heiresses">seven heiresses</a>.  The marriages of these women begin to generate considerable interest, with connections to larger events and more significant domains in Europe.<br clear=left>

<P><center><img src="history/nevers1.gif"></center>

<P>The first heiress, Agnes, married Peter de Courtanay, a grandson of Louis VI of France, who, after her death, would be elected one of the <a href="romania.htm#latins">Latin Emperors</a> of Romania.  As part of that arrangement, he then married Yolanda of Flanders, the Latin heiress.  While he was then able to father the heirs to the Latin Throne, he never made it to Constantinople.  He became the second Latin Emperor to be captured by enemies, in this case the Despot Theodore of <a href="romania.htm#epirus">Epirus</a> (who later would be captured by the Bulgarians), and die in captivity.  Yolanda became Regent for their sons.

<P>Meanwhile, the daughter, Mathilde, of Agnes and Peter was the heiress of Nevers.  She married relatively obscure noblemen, but her daughter Agnes, the next heiress, would marry a more noteworthy husband, Guy of <a href="#chatillon">Ch&acirc;tillon</a>, whose house was tangled with the Counties of <a href="#champ">Blois and Champagne</a> and also with nobility and princes of the Crusades -- including the infamous Reynald of Ch&acirc;tillon, whose treacherous behavior so angered Saladin, the Sult&acirc;n of <a href="islam.htm#ayyub">Egypt and Syria</a>, that when Reynald was captured at the Battle of the Horns of Hattin in 1187, the Sult&acirc;n, despite his reputation for mercy, reportedly killed him with his own hand.

<P>Agnes predeceased her mother, as did her daughter Yolande, who nevertheless seems to have been been made co-regent with Mathilde I.  Thus, Mathilde, with an extraordinary long reign of 65 years, and outliving her husbands, was predeceased by both her daughter and granddaughter (not too surprising in the Middle Ages), and when she died her great-granddaughter, Mathilde II, was the heiress of Nevers.  <img src="history/nevers2.gif" align=left>This results in some confusion, since Agnes is not included among the rulers of Nevers, and Yolande sometimes is not either.  So the reported succession jumps directly from Mathilde I to Mathilde II.

<P>The new Mathilde then made an important marriage indeed, to the House of the Dukes of <a href="#burgundy">Burgundy</a>, the (nominal?) <I>de jure</I> suzerains of Nevers.  Nevers was then briefly tangled in the affairs of Burgundy, with judgments required about her own heirs, who were all daughters, among whom the fiefdoms of Nevers were distributed.  Perhaps the most fateful marriage was then made by her eldest daughter, Yolande II, heiress of Nevers, which was to Robert III, the Count of <a href="#">Flanders</a>, one of the more important and venerable feudatories of Francia.  The began a joyright of inheritance much like that of the Hapsburgs, and, indeed, it would finally lead to the Hapsburgs.

<P>Thus, Yolande's grandson, Louis I, would marry one of the the heiresses, Margaret, of the Free County.  His granddaughter, Margaret II, then the heiress of Flanders and Nevers, would marry Philip, the first Valois Duke of Burgundy.  This fatefully united Never, Flanders, and Burgundy.  All that was lacking was one more marriage to unite Flanders and Burgundy (with the Emperor <a href="francia.htm#hapsburg-0">Maximilian</a>).

<P>However, the Duke Philip had meanwhile detached Nevers, bestowing it on a younger son, also Philip.  This led to another heiress, Elizabeth, who married John I, the Duke of <a href="deutsch.htm#cleves">Cleves-Mark</a>.  John himself separated the domains, so that Cleves-Mark and Nevers-Auxerre continued under their own lines.

<P>In those terms, Nevers continued for four generations until another heiress, Henriette, and another fateful marriage, to the Gonzagas of <a href="italia.htm#mantua">Mantua</a>.  This was not the main lineage of Mantua, but when that itself came to an heiress, Maria, she married Charles, the heir of Nevers, who nevertheless predeceased his father, who himself had to fight a bit of a war (of the Manuan Succession, 1628-1631) to claim the inheritance.  Two more Dukes of Mantua ended in the extinction of the line and the reversion of the Duchy of Nevers to the French Throne in 1708.  Meanwhile, intermarriage with the Hapsburgs and the House of Lorraine put this lineage at the head of subsequent <a href="francia.htm#succession2">Hapsburgs</a>, where perhaps one of the most noteworthy features is that the Gonzagas were descended from the Dynasty of the <a href="romania.htm#paleolo">Palaeologi</a> Emperors in Constantinople.  It was late in the game, but Nevers joined in that connection.

<P>The information for the genealogy here is from <a href="http://my.raex.com/~obsidian/regindex.html">Bruce R. Gordon's Regnal Chronologies</a> (which, however, gives succession but not genealogy), several pages at Wikipedia on individual Counts and Countesses (which do give genealogical information but in a fragmented way, sometimes with missing links), and the <I>Erz&auml;hlende genealogische Stammtafeln zur europ&auml;ischen Geschichte</I>, by Andreas Thiele.

Fischer Verlag, Second Edition, 2001].  Volume III contains a general index, which was needed more than usual, since the many heiresses of Nevers jump the lineage from one entry to another, often across different Volumes of the work.<br clear=left>

The County of Anjou ends up playing a significant role in the history of France and England.  Perhaps the larger impact begins with Fulk V going off on Crusade and ending up King of Jerusalem, married to the heiress Queen Melisende.  His son Geoffrey then marries the daughter, Matilda, of King Henry I of England, who had recently lost her husband, the Emperor <a href="francia.htm#frank-2">Henry V</a> -- so she is often called the "Empress."  There was a dispute over the Kingship of her cousin Stephen -- she had disputed it herself in 1141.  Geoffrey took Normandy from him in 1144.  Then Geoffrey's son Henry succeeded Stephen as the first Plantagenet King of England, Henry II.

<P>The term "Plantagenet" comes from <I>planta genesta</I>, a yellow flower, a species of gorse, that grows in the area.  The name got attached to the family because Count Geoffrey used to wear the flowers on his helmet.  His direct male descendants would rule England until the Tudors -- the Houses of Lancaster and York simply derived from younger sons of Edward III.

<P>The last Plantagenet to formally bear the title Count of Anjou was the eldest son, Henry, of King Henry II.  The young Henry predeceased his father.  Although Anjou was subsequently held by King Richard and King John, they did not assume the title.  Then Anjou as lost to <a href="francia.htm#capet">Philip II</a> of France in 1204.

<P>Anjou was revived as a Duchy for Charles, the brother of King Louis IX of France, in 1246.  The line of these Dukes of Anjou is not given here, because Charles went off and became King of <a href="italia.htm#anjou-2"><B>Naples and Sicily</B></a>, which then became the effective seat of the Anjevian family -- the genealogy is given there.  Charles lost Sicily, but his descendants would rule Poland and Hungary as well as Naples, until the death of Joanna II in 1435.<br clear=left>

<P>The end of the Capetian Anjevians meant that the Duchy was available for a new Royal brother.  This ended up being Louis of <a href="francia.htm#valois">Valois</a>, brother of King Charles V.  Louis also inherited <a href="lorraine.htm#provence">Provence</a>, which Charles of Anjou had acquired through his wife, Beatrice, Countess of Provence.  The special association of the Valois Dukes of Anjou, however, soon became <a href="lorraine.htm#rene"><B>Lorraine</B></a>, <img src="history/anjou2.gif" align=left>when the grandson of Louis, Ren&eacute; the Good, married Isabel, the heiress of Lorraine.  At the death of Joanna II, Ren&eacute; tried to press Anjevian claims to Naples, but Alfonso V of <a href="perifran.htm#sicily2">Arag&oacute;n</a> simply conquered the Kingdom for his family.  When Ren&eacute; died in 1480, all of his male heirs had predeceased him.  His daughter Yolande's right to inherit was denied by King Louis XI.  This royal claim was made good in 1481; and Anjou, Provence, and Maine reverted permanently to the French Crown.  Yolande, however, was left with Lorraine and Bar, to which was added the County of Guise, the possession of her husband.  Later Guise was broken off as a separate Duchy for her grandson Claude.  All this genealogy, and its subsequent history, can be examined at <a href="lorraine.htm#rene">Lorraine</a>.

<P>When Anjou fell to the King of France, so did the Anjevian claims to Naples.  This led to the invasion of Italy by Charles VIII, who occupied Naples 1494-5 but could not keep it.  The Aragonese heirs of Naples were soon pushed aside (1501) by King Ferdinand II of Arag&oacute;n, King of a united <a href="perifran.htm#conquest">Spain</a> with his wife, Isabella of Castile.  Ferdinand integrated Naples into the many Spanish possessions, and Spain was then the predominant power of the day.  Until the French Revolution, France never returned to Naples -- though <a href="italia.htm#bourbon">Spanish Bourbons</a> did.

<P>Along <img src="history/normandy.gif" align=right>
with <a href="italia.htm#sicily">Naples, Sicily</a> and <a href="russia.htm#kiev">Russia</a>, Normandy was one of the great enduring foundations of the age of Norse expansion.  With the decline of Carolingian power, there wasn't much that Charles the Simple of France could do about Viking raiding, so the idea seems to have been that if you can't beat 'em, join 'em, or at least have them join you.  So someone who was essentially a pirate leader, Rollo, a son of Ragnald I the Wise, Earl of <a href="germania.htm#orkney">Orkney</a>, was enfeoffed with some of the land that he had been raiding.  This grew into a large domain, and entered into normal feudal and marriage relations with the rest of Europe, though for many years with little effective supervision of the Kings of France.<br clear=right>

<P>The flag is modern, proposed by local separatists and based on the common design of other <a href="perifran.htm#scandinavia">Scandinavian</a> flags.

<P><img src="history/norman-1.gif" align=right>The Normans, although retaining their name and a considerable share of Viking aggressiveness, nevertheless assimilated to the culture of their new land.  They began to speak French and before long they even denied landing to further Viking forces.

<P>As the Northern Vikings quieted down a bit, Normandy itself launched new conquests.  In 1035 the de Hauteville brothers arrived from Normandy in <a href="italia.htm#sicily">Southern Italy</a>.  Driving out Arabs and Romans, no less than six brothers would eventually rule in Apulia, Calabria, and Sicily, all assembled as the Kingdom of Naples and Sicily in 1130.  Just as the de Hautevilles were beginning, Duke William II the Bastard came to the throne of Normandy.  He would conquer England in 1066 and acquire a more auspicious name for posterity:  &nbsp;William the Conquerer.
<br clear=right>

<P><img src="images/maps/anjou.gif" align=right>

Normandy subsequently became part of the story of the relations of England and France.  England itself became the center of power of the Dukes, although their French culture was imposed there.  English Kings spoke French for many generations and the English language was permanently altered by French.  Pure Norman French words still echo in some British and American legal usage, as with "voir dire," the examination of prospective jurors.  This is noteworthy today when France fights a desperate battle to prevent the assimilation of a few English words picked up from television, movies, etc. into French, while English itself, since Middle English, reflects the most profound French influence.  This greatly enriched English vocabulary; but the French Academy would rather coin "pure" French neologisms than simply borrow them from English.  The absurdity of this was revealed in a debate on French television over some new law to limit the use of English words.  The moderator, frustrated at the heated cacophony of argument, simply shouted, "Shut up!" -- much punchier than Latinate periphrasis.<br clear=right>

<P><img src="history/norman-2.gif" align=left>

<P>William did divide England and Normandy between two of his sons, but Robert II, Duke of Normandy, took out a loan from his brother, William II of England, secured by Normandy itself, so that he could go on the First Crusade (1096-1099).  He returned with no money from the Crusade, so his other brother, Henry I, who meanwhile had succeeded to the Throne of England, repossessed Normandy in payment.  This left Robert's son William with no inheritance, but he ended up acquiring <a href="#">Flanders</a>, thanks to his great-grandfather having been Count Baldwin V of Flanders.  William, however, was killed in battle in 1128, otherwise he would have inherited England in 1135, instead of his cousin Stephen of <a href="#champ">Blois</a>.  The succession of Stephen, however, was disputed by Henry's daughter Matilda.  After a fruitless marriage to the Emperor <a href="francia.htm#frank-2">Henry V</a>, Matilda had married the energetic Count of Anjou and Maine, Geoffrey Plantagenent.  Matilda and Geoffrey invaded England, and then Normandy.  Normandy they got away from Stephen, who then agreed in 1153 to the succession in England of Maltida's son Henry, who thus founded the Plantagenet House of England.  Henry's son John later lost Normandy (1202-1204) to Philip II of France, thus returning to the King of France the domain ceded by Charles III to Rollo back in 911.

<P>Later, King Edward III claimed the Throne of France, and in the course of the Hundred Years War (1337-1453), the English sometimes occupied Normandy.  At the end of the War, the only mainland territory that was held was Calais, later lost by Henry VIII.  The King of England, however, continued to claim the French Throne right down to the Napoleonic Era, when British support for the exiled Louis XVIII would not have been consistent with continuing English claims.  However, part of the Duchy of Normandy did actually remain in English hands:  &nbsp;The Channel Islands.  Those remain British, even until today, after the curious episode of being the only part of England occupied by Nazi Germany.<br clear=left><center><img src="images/key.gif"></center>

<P>The County of Champagne was on the east side of the French Royal Domain, the <I>&Icirc;le de France</I>, while the County of Blois was on the west side.  The earliest Counts of Champagne here are the Carolingian Counts of <a href="francia.htm#vermandois">Vermandois</a>.  With the end of that line, Champagne passed to the Counts of Blois.

<P><center><img src="images/maps/capet-1.gif"></center>

<P>The list of the counts is from Bruce R. Gordon's <a href="http://my.raex.com/~obsidian/regindex.html">Regnal Chronologies</a> and the WW-Person, A WWW Data base of European nobility.  The genealogical diagram is based on Brian Tompsett's Royal and Noble genealogy.  Tompsett does not include all of the Counts, either of Champagne or Blois, and the numbering is a little confusing.  Tompsett leaves out Theobald II of Blois and all the higher numbers are one less than in WW-Person.  Gordon does not have a chronological list for Blois, but WW-Person does, which is not entirely consistent with Thompsett's genealogy.  WW-Person does not list Gello and leaves a chronological gap beteen Robert and Theobald I; the ealier Eudes/Odo is not numbered in the later sequence; and Odo II of Champagne is left out.  There are many disagreements or discrepancies about the dates.  I have not indicated all the alternatives.  See below for some new information.

<P>Champagne remains famous, of course, for the sparkling wine which is now <I>de rigueur</I> for all occasions of significance in the Westernized world, from marriages to New Year's Eve.  Although there are other comparable sparkling wines, by law only those from grapes grown in Champagne can be called "Champagne."<br clear=left>


<P><img src="history/champ.gif" align=left>

<P>The genealogical chart highlights the history of interesting marriage alliances of the House of Blois and Champagne, which contributed a King of England (Stephen) and especially had two sons marrying daughters of King Louis VII of France by Eleanor of <a href="#aquitaine">Aquitaine</a>, while their sister married Louis himself and became of the mother of the great Philip II Augustus.  Then two cousins of Philip married Isabella the Queen of Jerusalem and Blanca the heiress of Navarre.<br clear=left>

<P><a name="navarre"><img src="history/champ-1.gif" align=left></a>From Blanca (more commonly called "Blanche" in the French context), we get the entire subsequent line of <a href="perifran.htm#navarre">Navarre</a>, whose heiresses later married the French King Philip IV, the French counts of Evreux, <a href="#foix">Foix</a>, and Albret, King John II of Arag&oacute;n, and finally Anthony Duke of Vend&ocirc;me, the heir of the Bourbons.  The son of Jeanne III of Navarre and Anthony was then King Henry III of Navarre, who became King Henry IV of <a href="francia.htm#bourbon">France</a>.  The County of Champagne, however, once in the hands of Philip IV, reverted to the French Throne.

<P>At left is the succession to the throne of Navarre by the Counts of Champagne, leading to the ultimate marriage of Jeanne/Juana I to Philip IV.  The succession of their children to <a href="francia.htm#capet">France</a> and <a href="perifran.htm#navarre">Navarre</a> can be examined on those pages.

<P>Tompsett does not show the genealogy for Blois after Theobald V.  I was then provided by a correspondent in the Netherlands with this information, gleaned from Volumes II (tables 46 & 47), III (table 50), and VII (tables 17 & 18) of the <I>Europ&auml;ische Stammtafeln, Stammtafeln zur Geschichte der Europ&auml;ichen Staaten, Neue Folge</I>, edited by Detlev Schwennicke (Verlag J.A. Stargardt, Marburg, 1979 & 1984).  Hugh I is of the House of Ch&acirc;tillon, and is a relative of Reynald of Ch&acirc;tillon, Prince of <a href="outremer.htm#antioch">Antioch</a>.  WW-Person's page on Ch&acirc;tillon is blank, and Tompsett does not give any genealogical connection for Reynald besides his marriage to the heiress of Antioch.  The correspondent in the Netherlands, however, has sent along information from the <I>Europ&auml;ische Stammtafeln</I>, detailed <a href="#chatillon">below</a>.  After Guy II, the County was purchased by Louis, the first <a href="francia.htm#valois">Valois</a> Duke of Orl&eacute;ans, whose grandson became King Louis XII, whereby Orl&eacute;ans and Blois became Crown lands.

<P>I have now been able to make some additional corrections from the new <I>Erz&auml;hlende genealogische Stammtafeln zur europ&auml;ischen Geschichte</I>, Volume II, Part 1, <I>Europ&auml;iche Kaiser-, K&ouml;nigs- und F&uuml;rstenh&auml;user I Westeuropa</I> [Andreas Thiele, R. G. Fischer Verlag, Third Edition, 2001].  My previous information was that Louis I of Blois was another son of Henry I.  However, this source shows his parents, and those of Margaret of Blois, as Theobald V and Alice of France, which is tidier, since it means that Blois and Champagne split permanently between Theobald V and Henry I.  Using these <I>Stammtafeln</I>, I have made some other corrections in the material above -- and will continue to do so as I examine the tables.
<br clear=left>

<P><a name="chatillon"><img src="history/chatilon.gif" align=left></a>

The Lords of Ch&acirc;tillon lead to a number of historically important marriages.  Reynald (or Renaud) of Ch&acirc;tillon, as noted, becomes Prince of <a href="outremer.htm#antioch">Antioch</a> through marriage to the heiress, Constance, of Prince Bohemond II.  They had no issue, and Reynald was even repudiated by Constance.  Reynald's subsequent mischief so angered the Sult.&acirc;n of Egypt, <a href="islam.htm#ayyub">Saladin</a>, that he was killed, in some accounts, at the hand of the Sult.&acirc;n himself, after being captured at the Battle of the Horns of Hattin in 1187.

<P>Next, we get the marriage of Gaucher III to Elizabeth, Countess of St. Pol.  The succession to St. Pol eventually included Philip of <a href="#philip2">Burgundy</a> (1415-1430) and Peter I of <a href="lorraine.htm#luxemold">Luxemburg</a> (1431-1433).  I have a list of the succession to St. Pol but no information on how those connections all worked.

<P>After this, of course, we get the marriage, as recounted above, of Hugh of Ch&acirc;tillon to the heiress, Mary, of Blois, from whom subsequent Counts of Blois and St. Pol derive.

<P>A correspondent in the Netherlands provided this information from the <I>Europ&auml;ische Stammtafeln, Stammtafeln zur Geschichte der Europ&auml;ichen Staaten, Neue Folge</I>, Volume VII, edited by Detlev Schwennicke (Verlag J.A. Stargardt, Marburg, 1979), Table 17.  I have now been able to make some corrections, and anticipate making others, using the <I>Erz&auml;hlende genealogische Stammtafeln zur europ&auml;ischen Geschichte</I>, Volume III, <I>Europ&auml;iche Kaiser-, K&ouml;nigs- und F&uuml;rstenh&auml;user Erg&auml;nzungsband</I> [Andreas Thiele, R. G. Fischer Verlag, Second Edition, 2001].  Unfortunately, this source does not show Reynald of Ch&acirc;tillon as the brother of Gaucher II.  Under the Princes of Antioch, Reynald is identified as the son of the Seigneur Gottfried of Ch&acirc;tillon-sur-Loing, but this line does not seem to be included on the table for Ch&acirc;tillon.<br clear=left>

The County of Toulouse was the legendary center of the special culture of the <B>Languedoc</B>, the South of France where the language, Proven&ccedil;al, rather close to Catalan today, was distinct from the North of France, <I>Languedoil</I>.  The names come from a difference between the words for "yes":  &nbsp"hoc" in the South and "oil" in the North -- "oil" became "oui" in Modern French.

<P>Under the influence of the love poetry of Isl&acirc;mic Spain, the Troubadours introduced the idea of romantic love into Western Europe.  Unfortunately, other things were introduced as well.  The Cathari (the "Pure," or Albigensians) reportedly practiced a form of religion reflecting Manichean dualism.  For tolerating this heresy, in 1207 Count Raymond VI was excommunicated and his domains were placed under an interdict by Pope <a href="popes.htm#fourth">Innocent III</a>.

<P>Raymond was eager to appease the Pope, but when the Papal legate Castelnau was murdered in 1208, Raymond was blamed and sterner measures were considered necessary.  Innocent declared a "Crusade" against the heretics and the, at least, dilatory Count.  Led by Simon de Montfort, the Crusade visited widespread destruction.  In one infamous incident, after the fall of one city, B&eacute;ziers, in 1209, all the inhabitants, heretical or not, were put the sword.  One Crusader, Amal Ulric, reportedly instructed his men <I>Neca eos omnes. Deus suos agnoscet</I>, "Kill them all. God will recognize his own."  Raymond VI was defeated in 1213 and temporarily deprived of his fief.<br clear=right>

<P><img src="images/maps/toulouse.gif" align=right>After the death of de Montford in 1218, the Count's fortunes revived.  His son Raymond VII recovered the core of Toulouse.  Nevertheless, the settlement of 1229 ceded much of the domain of Toulouse to the Crown.  The daughter of Raymond VII was married to a son, Alphonse, of King Louis VIII of France.  This might have led to a flourishing house of Poitiers in Languedoc, but the couple were childless, and in 1271 the remaining County reverted to the Throne.<br clear=left><br clear=right>

<P><img src="images/maps/toulous2.gif" align=left>The domain of Alphonse compares favorably with that of his brother, <a href="italia.htm#anjou-2">Charles of Anjou</a>.  Like Alphonse, Charles was married to an heiress, in his case of <a href="lorraine.htm#provence">Provence</a>.  More importantly, Charles was offered Naples and Sicily by the Pope.  He got them, but then lost Sicily.  The House of Anjou then ruled Naples, and later Hungary and Poland, until 1435.  The domain of Alphonse in France is more impressive than that of Charles, but it was not, of course, the possession of any enduring house.

<P>Meanwhile, some years before, Count Raymond IV had gone on the First Crusade.  After Jerusalem was taken, his job was to reduce the city of Tripoli, today in northern Lebanon.  He died before the city surrendered, but was nevertheless credited as the first  <a href="outremer.htm#tripoli">Count of Tripoli</a>.  When the city finally fell in 1109, his (perhaps illegitimate) son Bertrand took over, and his descendants  ruled as the Counts of Tripoli until 1187, the year, as it happens, that Jerusalem was retaken by <a href="islam.htm#ayyub">Saladin</a>.  This was well before the sad destruction of the culture and prosperity of Languedoc.

<P>The chronology of the Counts is from <a href="http://my.raex.com/~obsidian/regindex.html">Bruce R. Gordon's Regnal Chronologies</a> and WW-Person, A WWW Data base of European nobility, and the genealogy from Brian Tompsett's Royal and Noble Genealogy, with modifications from <I>The New Cambridge Medieval History, Volume III, c.900-c.1024</I> [Timothy Reuter, editor, Cambridge 1999].  All these sources have sometimes wildly different names, sequences, and dates.  I have tried to reconcile things somewhat, but I have left other inconsistencies, of dates and identities, in place out of frustration.  Gordon lists "Humfrid" as of a different House than the other Counts (he doesn't appear at all in WW-Person), so I assume he would not appear in the genealogy; but Tompsett's overlapping dates otherwise seem to cover the period, and he doesn't give anyone who might be "Bernard II" (Gordon has the two Bernards in sequence, while WW-Person separates them by some 20 years).  So, not being familiar with the sources, and having in hand only general histories that don't bother with such details (the Cambridge <I>History</I> only covers a limited period), I threw up my hands and left it.  Now I hope to improve this with information from the <I>Erz&auml;hlende genealogische Stammtafeln zur europ&auml;ischen Geschichte</I>, Volume II, Part 1, <I>Europ&auml;iche Kaiser-, K&ouml;nigs- und F&uuml;rstenh&auml;user I Westeuropa</I> [Andreas Thiele, R. G. Fischer Verlag, Part 1, Third Edition, 2001] but have not yet analyzed the Toulouse pages [pp.171-173].

<P>The culture of the South of France in the 12th century is one of the first signs of the revival of civilization in Francia after the "second Dark Age" of the 9th and 10th centuries.  The high point of this, in both romance and politics, was perhaps the life of Eleanor (Ali&eacute;nor, El&eacute;onore, &Eacute;l&eacute;onore) of Aquitaine, heiress of Aquitaine (<I>Aquitania</I>), Queen of both France and England, mother of both Richard the Lionheart and the miserable King John.

<P>The chronology here is drawn from <I>The Mammoth Book of British Kings & Queens</I>, by Mike Ashley [Carroll & Graf Publishers, Inc., New York, 1999, pp.729-731].  There are several differences between this and the genealogy, which is constructed from Brian Tompsett's Royal and Noble Genealogy, <a href="http://my.raex.com/~obsidian/regindex.html">Bruce R. Gordon's Regnal Chronologies</a>, and <I>The New Cambridge Medieval History, Volume III, c.900-c.1024</I> [Timothy Reuter, editor, Cambridge, 1999].  I have no idea how to reconcile the differences, especially between Ashley and the Cambridge History.  Some material at the top of the genealogy has now been added from the <I>Erz&auml;hlende genealogische Stammtafeln zur europ&auml;ischen Geschichte</I>,  Volume II, Part 1, <I>Europ&auml;iche Kaiser-, K&ouml;nigs- und F&uuml;rstenh&auml;user I Westeuropa</I> [Andreas Thiele, R. G. Fischer Verlag, Part 1, Third Edition, 2001].

<P>The early period seems to involve a tug-of-war between the Counts of Poitiers (Poitou), Auvergne, and Toulouse for possession of the Duchy.  There seem to be some confusions and disagreements between the sources.  The <a href="http://www.eb.com/">Encyclopaedia Britannica</a>, for instance, says that William I the Pious, Count of Auvergne and Duke of Aquitaine, died in 926.  However, Ashley, Tompsett, Gordon, and the Cambridge <I>History</I> all agree that William <B>II</B> died in 926, and William I the Pious in 918.  It should be noted that William III of Aquitaine is sometimes reckoned to begin a new sequence of numbering, as William I, which means that Eleanor's father, William X, is also found called William VIII.

<P>Almost every map <img src="images/maps/aquitain.gif" align=right>I have seen for this period shows different boundaries for the domains.  Since I doubt that much was done in the way of accurate surveying (or even definition) of boundaries, or that such records would even survive, this is not surprising.  The map at right is mainly based on Donald Matthew, <I>Atlas of Medieval Europe</I> [Equinox, Facts on File, New York, Oxford, 1983, 1989, p.98].  The domain of the House of Anjou is in red, with Normandy, already ruled by Henry Plantagenet before the end of the reign of King Stephen of England, in blue.  William L. Langer's <I>An Encyclopedia of World History; Ancient, Medieval, and Modern, Chronologically Arranged</I> [Houghton, Mifflin, Company; the Riverside Press, Boston, 1940, 1948, 1952, 1960] shows Toulouse as part of the "lands held or claimed [by Henry II of England] through marriage with Eleanor" [p.192], but Toulouse apparently was not "held" and the "claim" was not realized, which makes it puzzling why that should be included on the map.

William VIII of Aquitaine acquired the Duchy of Gascony in 1052.  This domain was originally founded by the <B>Basques</B>, and is actually named after them, from <I>Vascones</I>.  The Duchy was thus <I>Vasconia</I>, from which we get <I>Gascogne</I> in French.  The names of the Dukes of Gascony thus are much like the names with patronymics of the early Basque Kings of <a href="perifran.htm#spain">Navarre</a>, e.g. "Sancho Garc&eacute;s" and "Garc&iacute;a S&aacute;nchez" occur in both places.  When the male line of the Dukes ended in 1032, claims by marriage could have been made by <a href="lorraine.htm#provence">Barcelona</a> and Aquitaine, but Sancho III of Navarre made good on acquiring the Duchy.  After his death in 1035 Navarre lost control, but I am unaware of what was going on until the claim of Aquitaine was made good.  Henceforth, the fortunes of Gascony would be tied to those of Aquitaine, which increasingly came to be called <I>Guienne</I> or <I>Guyenne</I>.

<P>The contradictory information about Aquitaine seems much worse for Gascony.  To the sources cited above is now added WW-Person, A WWW Data base of European nobility, which gives most of the Dukes before Sancho I Mitarra.  The dates that Person gives before 1010 (or 1009) are often substantially different from those in the other sources.  The dates in the table are <img src="history/gascon.gif" align=right>largely his, while those in the genealogy are more those of Brian Tompsett and others.  Some key dates are simply unknown.  There also seems to be some question about the sequence of Arnaud (Arnold) and Sancho I Mitarra.

<P>A significant marriage here is of Sancha of Gascony to Duke William V of Aquitaine.  However, her name is also given as "Prisca," and her father is variously given as Sancho William, William Sancho, and William S&aacute;nchez.  Sancha's children, however, did not give rise to the subsequent Dukes of Aquitaine.  Duke William V had three wives, and subsequent Dukes were descendants of William VIII, son of William V and Agnes of <a href="lorraine.htm#franchecomte">Burgundy</a>.

<P>The brother of William X married the heiress of the Crusader Principality of Antioch.  That marriage and the succession to Antioch can be examined at the genealogy for the Sicilian <a href="italia.htm#sicily">Normans</a>.  The most complicated part of the chart covers the marriages, not just of Eleanor, but of her first husband, Louis VII of France.  Louis ended up marrying the sister-in-law of his own daughters by Eleanor (Adele, sometimes given as Alice).  On the other hand, Eleanor's daughter, Eleanor also, by Henry II, married the nephew of Louis VII's second wife (Constancia of Castile).  Their daughter Blanca (Blanche in French) was fetched from Spain in 1200 by a 78-year-old Eleanor herself to marry Louis VII's grandson, Louis VIII.  Blanche became the mother of St. Louis and Charles of Anjou.  Subsequent Dukes of Aquitaine were all heirs or Kings of England, until all English possessions in France (except Calais) were lost in the last days of the Hundred Year's War.<br clear=left>

<P><a name="winter"><center><img src="history/aquitain.gif"></center>

<P>The great movie <I>The Lion in Winter</I> [1968] gives us a picture of the family of Eleanor of Aquitaine and her husband Henry II of England.  We get Katharine Hepburn as Eleanor and Peter O'Toole as Henry.  Equally interesting is the supporting cast.  Prince Richard is played by no less than Anthony Hopkins, most famous later as <a href="poly-1.htm#text-3">Hannibal Lecter</a>.  King Philip II of France is played by Timothy Dalton, who starred as James Bond in two James Bond movies.  Noteworthy is Nigel Terry as Prince John, a most unsympathic character, and later regarded as the worse King in English history; but Terry himself would later memorably play no less than <a href="romania.htm#arthur">King Arthur</a> in John Boorman's movie <I>Excalibur</I> [1981].  Since Prince Henry died in 1183, and Prince Geoffrey in 1185, this "Christmas Court" of the movie would most likely be in 1184.  In the movie itself, however, Eleanor and Henry both say that the year is 1183.  Considering the recent death of Prince Henry, I find it a little unlikely that there would be so little comment about him at Christmas 1183.  We also have the anachronism of a <I>Christmas tree</I>, which was unknown to the English Court until introduced by Prince Albert, bringing the custom from Germany, after he married <a href="perifran.htm#potato">Queen Victoria<a>.

<P><img src="history/alice.gif" align=right>In a way, the most intriguing person in the movie is Princess Alice (Alys, Alix, Alais, etc.), Countess of Vexin and sister of Philip II (played by Jane Merrow -- who otherwise would mainly be familiar from British television, appearing in <I>The Prisoner</I> and <I>The Avengers</I>).  There is some question about her parentage.  Andreas Thiele shows her as the daughter of Louis VII and his third wife, Adelheid (Adele) of Champagne, born around 1170 [<I>Erz&auml;hlende genealogische Stammtafeln zur europ&auml;ischen Geschichte</I>, Volume II, Part 1, <I>Europ&auml;iche Kaiser-, K&ouml;nigs- und F&uuml;rstenh&auml;user</I> I <I>Westeuropa</I>, R. G. Fischer Verlag, Third Edition, 2001, p.56].  However, Wikipedia says she was born in 1160 to Louis's second wife, Constance of Castile, who died in childbirth.  Now, Thiele does say that Constance died in childbirth (<I>Kinderbett</I>), but then lists no child born in 1160 -- although, to be sure, the child might have died with the mother.  Nevertheless, it makes more sense that Alice was the child.  If she was born in 1160, and if movie is in 1183, then Alice was 23 years old at the time, which looks about right.  Eleanor at the time would have been 61 years old.  Katharine Hepburn already shows some of the tremors of the Parkinson's Disease she developed.  In the movie Henry mentions being 50.

<P>At the beginning of the movie Alice has become the lover of King Henry -- as seems to have been the actual rumor at the time -- even though she had been raised in his Court and is betrothed to Prince Richard.  Pope <a href="popes.htm#hadrian">Alexander III</a> (1159-1181) is supposed to have threatened Henry with an Interdict if the marriage was not performed.  It wasn't, and Richard married Berengaria, daughter of Sancho VI of <a href="perifran.htm#richard">Navarra</a>.  Alice's brother, King Philip, suggested that Alice marry John, but Eleanor rejected the offer.  In fact, the historical Alice never married any of the Princes, but she will marry a relatively obscure nobleman, William of Montreuil and Ponthieu.  However, their line does not remain obscure.  Alice's granddaughter, Jeanne (Joanna, etc.) will be the second wife of King Ferdinand III of Leon and Castile, after whom the <a href="perifran.htm#note-2">San Fernando Valley</a> of Los Angeles is named -- his first wife, Elizabeth of Hohenstaufen, was a granddaughter of the Emperor Isaac II Angelus of <a href="romania.htm#angelina">Romania</a>.  <I>Their</I> daughter, El&eacute;onore, marries Edward I of England and bears most of his children.  When she dies in 1290, Edward erected monuments where her funeral cortege stopped every night on the way to burial at Westminster.  The monument of <a href="foundatn.htm#cross">Charing Cross</a> (the "Eleanor Cross") has been recreated and slightly relocated (from Tafalgar Square) to the front of the Charing Cross train station, and it is traditionally regarded as the geographical center of London.  In this way, all subsequent rulers of England are descendants of Alice of Vexin, and we might be reminded of this every time we see or hear of Charing Cross Station.<br clear=right>

<P><img src="history/blanche.gif" align=right>One of the most extraordinary chapters in the life of Eleanor of Aquitaine may be the journey she undertook at age 77.  She went to Spain to escort a <a href="perifran.htm#eleanor">daughter</a> of King Alphonso VIII to marry a son of King Philip II of France.  The choice was between Urraca, the elder, and Blanca, younger.  Eleanor chose Blanca, who consequently became "Blanche of Castile," the mother of St. Louis IX of France.  Eleanor may have recognized a kindred spirit, since Blanche began to display a will and personality comparable to that of her grandmother.  The journey was not without its difficulties.  Eleanor was captured on her way by a robber baron, Hugh IX of Lusignan.  Disentangled from him, Eleanor also had difficulties on the way back with Blanca.  Resting in Bordeaux, an English possession, the women acquired a champion, called Mercadier, to escort them.  He, however, was then killed by enemies.  Reaching the Loire, Eleanor entrusted Blanca to the Archbishop of Bordeaux, who completed the trip.  From this, we might imagine that it was all too much for Eleanor.  But she lived another four years, although, as we might expect, in varying health.  Later, on Blanche herself fell the task of raising and leading armies in defense of her minor son, Louis IX, while she was Regent and opposed by nobles and Henry III of England.  She won battles and is even said to have helped collect firewood for the encampments.  Blanche also negotiated the Treaty of Paris of 1229, which ended the <a href="#toulouse">Albigensian Crusade</a> and lined up her son Alphonse as the next Count of Toulouse.  Eleanor would have been proud.  Blanche returned as Regent while Louis was off on his disastrous Crusades.

<P><img src="history/eleanor.gif" align=left>Eleanor's trip to Spain in 1199 was not the first time she traveled so far for a dynastic marriage.  In 1191, when she was only 69 years old, she went to Sicily to drop off a bride for her son Richard, recently become King, who had stopped off in Messina on his way to the Third Crusade.  Richard's sister Joanna had lately been the Queen of <a href="italia.htm#sicily">Sicily</a>, until her husband, William II, died.  His illegitimate cousin, Tancred, had become King; and relations, we might say, were a little strained.  And Richard wasn't getting along with Philip II of France, who was along, either.  There was some violence in Messina.  Eleanor did not linger for any of that, but headed home quickly.  Meanwhile, poor Berengaria of Navarra was faced with a husband who, apparently, was not interested in her, in any women, or, as far as we can tell, anyone at all.  So there was no issue to this marriage, and we get nothing remotely like the epic fruits of Eleanor's matchmaking in Spain.

<P>So there are many extraordinary stories here around Eleanor of Aquitaine, and <I>The Lion in Winter</I> seems to just scratch the surface.  Eleanor outlived all of her children, save for King John and Queen Eleanor of Castile.

In the foothills of the Pyrenees between Toulouse and Andorra, with the 10,305 ft. Pic Montcalm rising to the south, the County of Foix passes most of its history in relative obscurity.  The destiny of Foix ends up in association with the Kingdom of <a href="perifran.htm#navarre">Navarre</a>.  Count Gaston III marries the sister of King Charles the Bad of Navarre, but this relationship comes to naught when Gaston, the son of the Count and the only legitimate heir, is starved to death by his father.  The succession then jumps to Gaston's second cousin, Matthew, who himself has no heirs.  So the succession passes to Matthew's sister Isabella, who marries Archimbald of Grailly.  Their grandson, Gaston IV, then marries the heiress of Navarre, Leonore.  Leonore is briefly Queen of Navarre in 1479, after her husband and son have predeceased her, and so both Foix and the Throne of Navarre pass to her grandson, Francis Phoebus.  Eventually, when Henry III of Navarre becomes King of <a href="francia.htm#bourbon">France</a>, Foix passes to the French Throne.


<P>This list and genealogy is taken entirely from the <I>Erz&auml;hlende genealogische Stammtafeln zur europ&auml;ischen Geschichte</I>, Volume III, <I>Europ&auml;ische Kaiser-, K&ouml;nigs- und F&uuml;rstenh&auml;user Erg&auml;nzungsband</I> [Andreas Thiele, Second Edition, R.G. Fischer Verlag, 2001, pp.166-171].  When I originally consulted Brian Tompsett's Royal and Noble genealogy about this line, I think it was impossible to trace it beyond Gaston III.

<img src="history/foix-1.gif" align=left>

<P>I originally thought there might have been an association of the County with the cult of St. Faith -- <I>Foi</I> in French (or Ste. Foy) and Santa F&eacute; in Spanish.  "Foix" isn't exactly "Foi," but it might have been enough to get the association, if there was one, started (the "x" is not going to be pronounced in French).  Since the capital of New Mexico takes Santa F&eacute; as its name, the popularity of the Saint stretches all the way to the New World.  Now I discover that the principal shrine of St. Foi is in the area, but not in Foix.  It is at <B>Conques</B>, just about due north of Carcassonne and slightly south of east from Bordeaux.  The closest larger town is Rodez, which was a County itself in early Capetian days.  As far as I can tell, this ended up in the hands of the Counts of Toulouse (or of Auvergne).  Also not far away are two towns actually named after St. Foi, <B>S<sup>te</sup>-Foy-la-Grande</B>, in between Conques and Bordeaux, and <B>S<sup>te</sup>-Foy-l'Argenti&egrave;re</B>, further afield near Lyon.  St. Foi has only been resident at Conques, as it happens, since 877, when her relics were actually stolen from their original home, at the nearby Agen (Aginum).  Foi herself was supposed to have been a martyr from the reign of <a href="romania.htm#tetrarch">Diocletian</a>.  The most famous incident in the stories about her is probably that, having been taking bread from her family's kitchen to give to the poor, carrying it in a fold of her dress, she was one day confronted by her (non-Christian) father over what she was carrying.  She told him "flowers," but he insisted on seeing.  As she opened the dress, flowers indeed, not bread, fell from it.<br clear=left>

<P>The most durable of the ancient <a href="scotia.htm#celtic">Celtic</a> Kingdoms, Man, a large island in the Irish Sea, poised between Ireland, Wales, England, and Scotland, remains a constitutional anomaly in the United Kingdom.  Man has its own parliament, the Court of Tynwald; and laws passed by the British Parliament in Westminster only apply to Man if it is specifically mentioned in the law.

<P>The name "Man" seems to be derived from a legendary King <B>Manann&aacute;n</B>, who may also have been a god.  The adjective of "Man" is <B>Manx</B>, and this word can denote an inhabitant of Man (a "Manxman"), the remnant Celtic language, or the distinctive tailless Manx cat.

<P>The <img src="history/man-1.gif" align=right>Manx flag contains a unique and striking device of three rotating legs, the <I>trinacria</I> or <I>triskelion</I>.  This is a very old image, but may have come to Man with the Vikings.  It also turns up in Norman <a href="italia.htm#sicily">Sicily</a> and is sometimes said to have come from there.  The legs must always be seen rotating clockwise, so Manx flags must have two layers.  Since 1968 the flag has been officially flown on public buildings in Man.

Man was conquered in turn by the Irish, the Scots, the English of Northumbria (in 620), the Welsh, and then the Scottish Lord of the Hebrides (c.836).  In 853, the <a href="germania.htm#norse">Viking</a> Olaf the White became King of Dublin and established Ketil Flatnose as Jarl (Earl) of Man.  Man subsequently was fought over by the Norwegian Kings of Dublin and the Danish Kings of York, until York absorbed Dublin, around 914.  Man then came under the influence of <a href="germania.htm#orkney">Orkney</a> and was subjected to it by Earl Thorfinn the Mighty in 1038, but governed from Dublin until 1065.  After a bit of conflict, Godred Crovan, of uncertain origin, established himself as an independent King of Man in 1079.

<P><center><img src="history/man-2.gif"></center>

<P>At the end of this period, Man was fought over by <a href="perifran.htm#england">Scotland and England</a>.  Edward I of England, who annexed Wales and briefly even Scotland, seized Man in 1290.  Except for some brief episodes, the Island has remained under English suzerainty ever since.  In 1333, however, Edward III granted Man, with full sovereign rights, to William de Montacute (or Montague).  This gave Man a status rather like the French Duchies, such as <a href="#burgundy">Burgundy</a>, something otherwise rare to unheard of in English possessions.  Montague actually had to invade the Island, against local resistance, in 1341 in order to be crowned King.  <img src="history/man-3.gif" align=right>Then he left.  No King returned to Man until John II Stanley.  Meanwhile, two of the official Kings fell victim to the Wars of the Roses.  William le Scrope, who bought the island from William II, was a retainer of King Richard II and was executed by Henry IV.  Henry Percy, who received Man from Henry, was then killed in battle after he rebelled.  Henry bestowed Man on John Stanley in 1405.  His family remained sovereigns of Man until 1736.

<P>In 1660, the Stanleys gave up the ancient title of "King" and became merely "Lords of Man."  Queen Elizabeth II is still simply "Lord of Man."  There were two major glitches in the Stanley tenure on Man.  A dispute about the succession resulted in a hiatus from 1594 to 1612.  More significantly, James I, called the Great Stanley, was executed, as a Royalist, in the English Civil War.  His wife Charlotte held the Island until betrayed to Parliamentary forces.  A Commonwealth Governor, Lord Halifax, ruled the Island until the Restoration, when the Stanleys returned.  The Stanley line finally died out 1736; and James Murray, Duke of Atholl, became Lord.  His nephew and son-in-law, John Murray, surrendered the sovereignty of the Island to the British Crown in 1765 for &pound;70,000 (<a href="coins.htm#deflate">today</a> perhaps approaching $7,000,000), while retaining the title of Man until his death.

With his great Imperial colleague, Prince <a href="italia.htm#sardinia">Eugene of Savoy</a>, <B>John Churchill</B>, the 1st Duke of Marlborough, inflicted heavy defeats on <a href="francia.htm#bourbon">Louis XIV</a> in the War of the Spanish Succession (1701-1713), none more brilliant and decisive than <B>Blenheim</B>.  After Queen Anne gave Churchill the royal estate of Woodstock Park, Churchill, or even the Queen herself, gave the name of the battle to the great palace to be built on the land.  Churchill was a very great general and a very great man.  In this day and age, he is not well enough remembered.

<P><center><img src="images/blenheim.jpg"></center>

<P>Marlborough fought ten campaigns.  All successful.  Among them were four great battles, Blenheim (1704), Ramillies (1706), Oudenarde (1708), and Malplaquet (1709), all victories.  In each battle, Marlborough would launch an attack on one part of the French line, to which the French sent reinforcements, and then he would try to break through another, weakened part of the French line with reserves, or with forces transferred, often in a concealed way, from other parts of the army.  This worked perfectly at Blenheim and Ramillies.  After a dramatic and almost unprecedented long distance march across Germany and a sharp battle at the Schellenberg (where the Margrave <a href="deutsch.htm#baden">Louis of Baden</a> received a wound that later proved fatal), Marlborough, linking up with Eugene,  with inferior forces, went straight into an attack on the astonished French army.  With Marlborough breaking through the French center, the French right ended up surrounded and either surrendered, like their commander, or died.  The French left, engaged by Eugene, who sent reinforcements to Marlborough at the height of the battle, withdrew in relatively good order.  The French army, which had been advancing on Vienna, withdrew as a broken remnant across the Rhine.  Bavaria, allied with the French, was lost to the Elector <a href="germany.htm#wittelsbach">Maximilian II</a> for the rest of the war.

<P>At Ramillies, Marlborough, although shot off his own horse and almost ridden down, broke through so decisively that the French army all but disintegrated.  He quickly took most of the major cities in Belgium.  Ramillies was perhaps Marlborough's greatest battle and his most thorough and devastating victory.  That Belgium is not today part of France is arguably its consequence.  When his political critics wanted to credit Eugene for Marlborough's battles, Ramillies, where Eugene was absent, refuted the insinuations.  The most vivid incident of the battle may have been when an officer gave his horse to the dismounted Marlborough and then almost immediately had his head taken off by a cannonball.  Images of this actually were reproduced on playing cards.

<img src="images/blenhem2.jpg" align=right>

<P>Oudenarde occurred in a campaign that started with a French counterattack that retrieved some Belgian cities -- with the help of Belgians who were disillusioned by the treatment they received from the occupying Dutch.  Marlborough and Eugene, pursuing the French army, overtook and attacked it from behind.  Although not breaking through after the pattern of the earlier battles, they managed to execute a double envelopment of the French right -- the Holy Grail of battles, like <a href="hist-1.htm#carthage2">Hannibal</a> at Cannae.  Although the surrounded French forces were saved from annihilation by darkness, the force nevertheless disintegrated during the night.  The French left, actually unengaged in the battle, was left unable to prevent Marlborough from taking the French city of Lille and recovering the Belgian cities lately lost.

<P>Malpalquet was Marlborough's least successful battle -- perhaps in part because the French were beginning to understand his tactics.  The French left was driven back through a wood in heavy fighting and then a breakthrough was made in the French center.  However, Marlborough's cavalry was hampered in deploying by French trenches, and the French cavalry was able to withstand his attacks and hold the center line.  French forces were able to withdraw in their best order from any battle.  Meanwhile, there had been very great slaughter, especially in Dutch attacks against the French right.  No more sanguinary battle was fought until the Napoleonic Era.

<P>Marlborough's only defeat was a decisive one in his rear.  Although a Tory himself, Marlborough lost the support of the Tory Party, which didn't like the kind of continental campaign that the Duke was prosecuting so successfully.  Marlborough's wife, Sarah, was herself a ferocious Whig.  Although beginning as the Queen's closest friend, Sarah gradually alienated the Tory-hearted Anne.  For a short time, John remaining in the Queen's favor after Sarah had fallen out; but after Anne helped engineer a Tory electoral victory, the triumphant Party leaders dumped Marlborough and even prosecuted him.  European allies, especially the Germans, with no conception of British party politics, were entirely bewildered how the Queen could disown her own greatest general and leader.  Worse was to follow.  As Marlborough went into exile, the Tories double-crossed the Austrians and made a separate peace with France.  Eugene was abandoned on the battlefield and roughly treated by much superior French forces.  The death of Anne and the succession of George I of <a href="germany.htm#hanover">Hanover</a> restored Marlborough to his home and to his fortune and honor.  The Tories went into eclipse and disgrace for some time.

<P>Marlborough may have been the greatest general of the age, and one of the greatest of any age.  One of his qualities, identified by Winston Churchill in his biography of his ancestor, was that he was rarely at a loss when his plans became frustrated, whether by practical or political impediments.  Instead, he was simply able to promptly come up with new plans.  Since plans always go wrong in war, and many wars, no less than the War of the Spanish Succession, are bedeviled with political complications, this ability was a rare and valuable gift.  We see it in few other generals.

<P>Although the Tory betrayal of Britain's allies was shameful, the political goal of the war had become muddled.  The Austrian candidate for the Throne of Spain, Charles, became <a href="francia.htm#hapsburg-2">Emperor</a> on the death of his brother Joseph in 1711.  But no one (except Austria) wanted Spain and Austria united under one ruler any more than Spain and France, so Philip V in Spain became less objectionable, as long as the Kingdoms remained separate.  That was the substance of the settlement.<br clear=left>

<P><img src="history/marlboro.gif" align=left>The family name Churchill actually didn't last more than a generation.  The only son of John and his wife Sarah -- John also -- died in 1703.  The Dukedom thus passed to their daughter Henrietta and then, through their daughter Anne, to their grandson Charles Spencer.  In 1817, however, the 5th Duke was authorized to add the Churchill name to his own in order to preserve it with the descendants of the first Duke.

<P>The most noteworthy of the Spencer-Churchills, of course, is a grandson of the 7th Duke with whom the "Spencer" part is hardly ever remembered:  &nbsp;<B>Sir Winston Churchill</B>, born in Blenheim Palace in 1874, whose name thus echoes that of John Churchill's own father.  Winston is now pretty much THE Churchill in world history, having directed Britain through a crisis even more threatening than that of Louis XIV.  The French never bombed London.

<P>After Charles Spencer married Anne Churchill and became the ancestor of the Dukes of Marlborough, his nephew John was made Lord Spencer (1761), Viscount Spencer, and then Earl of Spencer (1765).  The Earls of Spencer lead directly to <B>Lady Diana Spencer</B>, daughter of the 8th Earl, who married Charles, Prince of Wales, in 1981 and became the mother of the most immediate Heirs of the Throne of <a href="perifran.htm#ERII">Great Britain and Northern Ireland</a>, Princes <B>William</B> and <B>Henry</B>.

<P>The nuptials of Diana and Charles have been regarded as the Wedding of the Century, broadcast live internationally in 1981.  Unfortunately, not only was Diana considerably younger than Charles, but Charles retained affection for his mistress, Camilla Parker Bowles.  The match with Diana was made more for political reasons than for genuine affection.  This took its emotional toll on Diana, who nevertheless bore two children and endured the sensation that she created wherever she went -- perhaps the <I>celebrity</I> of the Century as "Lady Di."  Diana and Charles separated in 1992 and were allowed by the Queen to divorce in 1995.  The sensation, however, continued to follow Diana and even led to her death, when she was mortally injured in an automobile speeding away from photographers in Paris in 1997.  The unprecedented outpouring of grief for Diana ensured her immortality and put Prince Charles in a very bad light.  One would hardly say that the Monarchy was endangered, with Diana's golden and winning sons (far handsomer than their father) in line for the throne, but Charles begins to look more and more like his great-uncle, King Edward VIII.  Since times have changed, and Charles and Camilla have been accepted by nearly all as a couple, it became possible that Charles could marry the divorced Camilla (as he did in 2005) and still become King without a constitutional crisis.  None of that, however, will affect the place of Diana as the mother of future Monarchs, which may be one reason why people can accept it.<br clear=left>

<P><a name="vanderbilt"><center><img src="images/key.gif"></center>

<H2><I>The Vanderbilts</I></H2>

<P>Winston Churchill's cousin, the 9th Duke of Marlborough, added another distinguished name to the family by marrying Consuelo Vanderbilt, whose own illustrious ancestor, <B>Cornelius Vanderbilt</B> (1794-1877), founded his name and fortune, not on European battlefields, but in American steamships and railroads -- which just goes to show how New Money soon enough becomes Old Money.  But this was not a happy marriage, apparently arranged mainly to get money to the Duke and prestige to the Vanderbilts.  Both Consuelo and the Duke had other people they would have prefered to marry.  <img src="history/vanderb.gif" align=left>Consuelo, who was actually taller than the Duke, was held as a virtual prisoner by her mother until she consented to the marriage.  After two children, whom she called "the Heir and the Spare," Consuelo and the Duke separated by 1907.  Consuelo, however, remained in England and was even elected to Parliament.  Winston's mother was also American.

<P><a name="text-1">Cornelius got his start when he borrowed $100 from his mother and began a ferry service that became the Staten Island Ferry.  His ferry service developed a run up the Raritan River in New Jersey, where his wife ran a hotel and raised their children in New Brunswick.  He graduated into running steamships up the Hudson River, violating the monopoly that the State of New York had granted.  The Supreme Court then ruled such monopolies unconstitutional.  After taking up shipping to California, Cornelius then settled into railroads, which continued to make the family fortune under his son, William.  The New York Central Railroad and Grand Central Station [<a href="#note-1">note</a>] in New York City were both Vanderbilt creations.  The result was some of the greatest wealth in the world, which the Vanderbilts became as adept at spending as well as, for a while, making.

<P>Indeed, each generation became <I>more</I> accomplished at spending money than at making it.  When Neil (Cornelius IV) Vanderbilt got a job at the <I>New York Herald</I> after World War I, his parents asked him to either quit the job or move out of their home.  He moved.  This incident tells the whole story, truly, of the decline of the family and its loss of prudence and virtue.  Neil's newspaper career briefly grew into a newspaper publishing empire, but after his appeal for some capital from his family, it was granted only on the condition that management be taken away from him.  Within a year the newspapers failed, at the cost of Neil's own inheritance.  In 1931 he reported that he was worth $120.  Thus, Neil was betrayed and ruined by his own family, whose preferred "professional" management drove his business into the ground.  Again, this tells the whole story of the decline of the family.

<P>Eventually, there were Vanderbilt mansions along Fifth Avenue at 459, 640, 642, 660, 666, 680, 684, 742-746, and 871.  The mansion of Cornelius Vanderbilt II, 742-746 Fifth Avenue, was on the site of the current Bregdorf Goodman department store, overlooking Grand Army Plaza.  Cornelius objected that the bare bottom of the statue in the Plaza was facing his bedroom window.  The city did nothing about it, so Cornelius moved his bedroom to the other side of the house.  Winston Churchill was a guest of the Vanderbilts at 640 Fifth Avenue on the night of 12 December 1931 when he was struck by an automobile crossing the street there -- somewhat the worse for drink, he forgot he was in a place where the traffic drives on the <a href="british.htm#side">right</a>.  Although all the Vanderbilt mansions on Fifth Avenue have now been demolished, others survive elsewhere to impress subsequent generations.

<P>Biltmore House, in Asheville, North Carolina, the largest residential home that had ever been constructed in the United States, built by George (Washington II) Vanderbilt, may be seen in the 1979 movie <I>Being There</I> (the last movie of Peter Sellers).  The house is actually unfinished because George ran out of money.  Nevertheless, by selling off land, opening the house to tourism, and, of course, as a movie location, George's descendants have been able to retain ownership.

<P>Later members of the family continued to spend without making, and many were no longer wealthy.  A family reunion at Vanderbilt University in 1973 of 120 descendants of Cornelius Vanderbilt did not include a single millionaire.  In recent history, the most conspicuous Vanderbilt has been Gloria, who in the 1980's especially became famous as a fashion designer.  She had also been famous in her infancy, the "poor little rich girl," when the family deprived her widowed, and to them untrustworthy, mother (there was shocking courtroom testimony of Lesbianism) of Gloria's custody.  Recently, her son, Anderson Cooper, has become a well known television reporter.

<P>Amy Vanderbilt (1908-1974), who made a name for herself with <I>Amy Vanderbilt's Complete Book of Etiquette</I> (1952), was not a descendant of Cornelius Vanderbilt, but, according to different accounts, from his brother or his uncle.

<P>Much of the genealogy of the Vanderbilts is from <I>The Vanderbilts</I>, by Jerry E. Patterson [Abrams, New York, 1989].  Details about the history of the family are largely drawn from <I>Fortune's Children, The Fall of the House of Vanderbilt</I>, by Arthur T. Vanderbilt II [Perennial, 1989, 2001].

<P>Arthur Vanderbilt's story is a sad and tragic one, but it is not clear that he has learned the right lessons.  At one point he makes a remarkable statement about the Gilded Age (the 1890's):

<P><blockquote>Common laborers made $2 to $3 a day, with the average worker earning $495 a year... By now it was clear that hard work and determination alone were not enough to rise from poverty [!], to eliminate the overcrowding, filth, and malnutrition from their lives.  The days of taking a periauger [or pirogue, the kind of small boat that Cornelius used in New York harbor] and building a fortune were a distant fantasy [!].  The realization was coming that these people were imprisoned by circumstance. [p.264]</blockquote>

<P><a name="text-2">Vanderbilt, of course, is writing about the period <I>before</I> people like <a href="capit-1.htm#ford">Henry Ford</a> made their fortunes, from nothing, let alone Bill Gates or Sam Walton.  After the turn of the Century, immigrants were flooding into America, and not because people thought that they would be "imprisoned by circumstance," even when they might only get a job at 50&cent; a day ($495 a year comes to about $1.60 a day -- $2 to $3 a day were made by "common laborers" only in elite or dangerous industries).  Arthur Vanderbilt may not realize that a good daily <a href="socrates.htm#text-12">wage</a> in modern Egypt may only be 5 current dollars a day, which would only be about 25&cent; in <a href="coins.htm#deflate">1890 dollars</a>.  According to <I>The Economist</I>, the annual GDP per capita of <a href="ethiopia.htm">Ethiopia</a>, by 2008, was only $140 [<I>The Economist, Pocket World in Figures, 2008 Edition</I>, p.28].  In 1890 dollars, this would only be <B>2&cent; a day</B> [<a href="#note-2">note</a>].  In those terms, the most miserable sweatshop in Lower Manhattan nevertheless represented wealth beyond the dreams of much of the modern Third World.

<P>With attitudes like this, it is no wonder that business success eluded the Vanderbilts after the first couple of generations.  Indeed, the lesson of both Arthur Vanderbilt's story and his attitude is that even the greatest concentrations of private wealth, even the virtual empire of economic power represented by Cornelius or William Vanderbilt, can be squandered by an imprudent family in just a couple further generations.  Family members later no longer know or even believe how the fortune could have been created in the first place.  It is not unlike the rise and fall of dynasties in four generations, as described by <a href="hist-1.htm#khaldun">Ibn Khaldun</a>.  Indeed, there is an equivalent American expression, "Shirt-sleeves to shirt-sleeves in three generations," said to be from a Lancashire proverb, perhaps brought by Andrew Carnegie himself from Scotland, "Theres nobbut three generations atween a clog and clog."  Comparable sayings in Italian are <I>Dalle stalle alle stelle alle stalle</I>, "From stalls to stars to stalls," and in Spanish <I>Quien no lo tiene, lo hance, y quien lo tiene, lo deshance</I>, "Who doesnt have it, does it, and who has it, misuses it."  Arthur Vanderbilt is probably lucky that he is well enough off to be writing a book about his family.

<H3 ALIGN="center">The Vanderbilts, Note 1;<br>Grand Central Station</H3>

<P><center><img src="images/key.gif"></center>

<P>When I was young, all I ever heard people say was "Grand Central Station."  Now, however, I see people asserting that it is <I>properly</I> "Grand Central Depot" or "Grand Central Terminal."  To be sure, it does say "Grand Central Terminal" on the building, and the tracks, originally of the New York Central Railroad, did end, terminate, at Grand Central Terminal; but to these purists a mere "station" would somehow mean that it is <I>not</I> the end of the line.  So it is improper to call a "terminal," especially the Grand Central Terminal, a "station."

<P>However, other usage betrays the novelty of the objection to "Grand Central Station."  In London, most of the train stations are terminals.  Indeed, a train ticket to London is liable to merely specify "London Terminals" as the destination.  <img src="images/char-95.jpg" align=right width=350>But no one ever says something like "Charing Cross Terminal" -- it is "Charing Cross Station" (seen at right in 1895 -- often mentioned in the <a href="foundatn.htm#holmes">Sherlock Holmes</a> stories).  Similarly, Euston, Paddington, King's Cross, and other London terminals are simply "stations" in ordinary parlance.

<P>The point is best made, however, with usage from New York City itself.  Everyone says "Penn Station."  I have never heard anyone say "Penn Terminal."  But Pennsylvannia Station was the terminus of the <a href="rand.htm#cassatt">Pennsylvania Railroad</a>, coming from the West, and also of the Long Island Railroad, coming from the East.  Penn Station was built, indeed, so that the Pennsylvania Railroad could terminate in Manhattan rather than on the Hudson in New Jersey.

<P>Also, on subway maps of New York today, stations where the lines terminate may be identified as, "Terminal stations."  If a terminal is not a station, this would be an oxymoron.

<P>Insisting that "Grand Central Station" is <I>incorrect</I> usage is thus, as <a href="pinker.htm">Steven Pinker</a> says, "gotcha! material for pedants and know-it-alls (the kind of people who insist that the <a href="century.htm">millennium</a> begins January 1, 2001)" [<I>Words and Rules</I>, Basic Books, 1999, p.54].  In other words, pedants, with, in this case, made-up knowledge, like to display their superiority by jerking people around.  We get a lot of this when, often for political reasons, people try to claim proprietary control over language or names.  Heaven help the person who innocently says "mentally retarded" in the presence of others more <I>au courant</I> with politically correct usage.  At least the anti-"Grand Central Station" <img src="images/station.jpg" align=left>crowd is not going to call you a bigot (yet).

<P>The ultimate irony is that the S-train, the Shuttle between Grand Central and Times Square, identifies itself on its own destination sign as going to "Grand Central Station."  Somebody at the Metropolitan Transit Authority did not get the memo about the "Terminal."<br clear=left>

<P>It is now inconceivable how anyone could live on <B>two cents</B> a day (roughly 45&cent; in 2000 dollars).  People doing something of the sort, of course, are probably subistence farmers and not part of a cash economy.  However, there is some evidence about prices in underdeveloped economies in the 19th century just from the coins that were issued to facilitate transactions in such places.  Thus, the smallest coin generally in circulation in <a href="coins.htm"><img src="images/coin-3.gif" align=right border=0>Britain</a> under the Gold Standard was the farthing, which was worth half a U.S cent -- a farthing was a quarter of an English penny, which thus was worth 2&cent;.  The United States and Canada both minted half cents for a while, but these were phased out by the 1860's in the United States and only briefly occurred at all early in the 1860's in Canada.  One gets the impression, therefore, that the smaller coin was needed in Britain itself.  Meanwhile, the British minted half and quarter farthings for circulation in <a href="buddhism.htm#ceylon">Ceylon</a> and third farthings for circulation in <a href="outremer.htm#malta">Malta</a>.  The half farthings were made current in Britain in 1842 but apparently were not needed and did not catch on.  One wonders what a quarter farthing, an eighth of a cent, could have bought in British Ceylon.  Since it would take <B>sixteen</B> of them to make a penny, it begins to sound like a penny might have been a significant amount of money for daily purchases.  Similarly, the smallest coin of <a href="coins.htm#india">British India</a> was the Pie, or 1/12 Anna.  On the exchange ratio with the Pound Sterling that was fixed in 1893, the Pie was worth exactly one third farthing, which puts us in the price territory of Malta, if not Ceylon.  Since Ethiopia is one of the poorest countries in the world, it might not be surprising if its standard of living is still no better than 19th century India, Malta, or Ceylon.<br clear=right>

<H2 ALIGN="center">Dukes of Buccleuch, Grafton,<br>& St. Albans, 1663-Present</H2>

<P><center><img src="images/key.gif"></center>

<P>King <B>Charles II</B> of <a href="perifran.htm#charles">England</a> had no legitimate children, i.e. no children with his Queen, Catharine of <a href="perifran.htm#braganza">Braganza</a> (who was troubled with stillbirths and miscarriages).  Nevertheless, the King had many children, by no less than seven mistresses, starting with <B>Lucy Walter</B>.  The eldest child was even a son, James Crofts, whom he made Duke of Monmouth after the Restoration, in 1663.  <img src="history/monmouth.gif" align=left>When James married Anne Scott, Countess of Buccleuch, in the same year, Charles made them the Duke and Duchess of Buccleuch -- and James took his wife's surname, which continues today with his descendants, among whom is the 9th Duke of Buccleuch.  James hoped to succeed his father as King of England.  After a failed plot in 1683, he went into exile, but then landed with an army in 1685 to depose his uncle, James II.  The new King had not yet provoked the opposition that would enable William of Orange to overthrown him in 1688, and Monmouth was captured and executed.

<P>The diagram shows two other mistresses and a living line of descent from each of them.  Charles fathered five or six children on <B>Barbara Villars</B>, Duchess of Cleveland, who later became involved with John Churchill, the 1st <a href="#marl">Duke of Marlborough</a> (her sixth child may have been Churchill's).  Barbara's children took the surname Fitzroy, Norman French for "son of the king" (Latin <I>filius regis</I>).  Her son Henry was made the 1st Duke of Grafton.  Today we have the 11th Duke.  <B>Nell Gwynne</B> (or Gwynn, Gwyn) was a popular actress who bore Charles two children.  Her children took the surname Beauclerk.  Her eldest son Charles was made the 1st Duke of St. Albans.  Today we have the 14th Duke.  The present Dukes of Bucclech, Grafton, and St. Albans all have living grandsons, as shown; and, apart from the little detail of the illegitimate origin of the families, they are, of course, Stuarts.<br clear=left>

<P><table align=right border><tr><td><img src="images/nellgwyn.jpg"></td></tr><tr><td><center><I>Portrait of a Young Woman and Child, as Venus and Cupid</I>,<br>by Peter Lely; understood to be Nell Gwynne</center></td></tr></table>The Restoration theater of Nell Gwynne's day allowed actresses on the stage -- at the King's request.  That had not been the case in Shakespeare's time.  Indeed, the City of London in that former era, controlled by Puritans, had not allowed theater at all.  But actresses were always regarded as a species of prostitute.  The loosening of morals in the reign of Charles is not only evident in the bawdiness of Restoration plays and in the presence of actresses, but even in the circumstance that Gwynne regarded <I>herself</I>, a mistress of the King, as a species of prostitute.  This emerges in a famous incident.  A carriage bringing Gwynne to the King on one occasion was showered with refuse by a crowd who believed the occupant to be the French (and Catholic) mistress whom Charles had acquired from Louis XIV (Louise de K&eacute;roualle).  However the public felt about the King, they certainly didn't like the French.  Gwynne, recognizing the nature of the error and the sentiment, stuck her head out the window and shouted, "Pray, good people, be civil, I am the <I>Protestant</I> whore!"  Among the lost opportunities of the movie <I>Restoration</I> [1994], the absence of this incident must rank high.<br clear=right>

<H2 ALIGN="center">Dukes of Berwick & Fitzjames, 1688-Present</H2>

<P><center><img src="images/key.gif"></center>

<P><img src="history/berwick.gif" align=left>

<a href="#monmouth">Charles II</a> was not alone in having important illegitimate children.  His brother <B>James II</B> had such children also.  His mistress was, in retrospect, extraordinary.  She was <B>Arabella Churchill</B>, the sister of John, later the <a href="#marl">Duke of Marlborough</a>.  With Arabella, James had four children.  The eldest, James, was made Duke of Berwick.

<P>Berwick fled England with his father after the Glorious Revolution in 1688.  He went on to a brilliant military career.  He was made a Marshall of France in 1706, and then made his name by defeating the British and Austrians in Spain, foiling their efforts to install the Austrian candidate there in the War of the Spanish Succession.  In 1710 he was made Duke of Fitzjames by Louis XIV of France.  He was much admired for both character and abilities by friend and foe.

<P>Berwick held to his father's cause and fought for France and Spain because he was, of course, Catholic.  His family then settled in Spain, where it has continued right down to the present, as shown.  Visiting <a href="#marl">Blenheim Palace</a> in 2006, I was startled to see a portrait of Berwick prominently displayed there.  The Duke of Marlborough never faced Berwick in battle, but his nephew gravely damaged the Duke's cause in the War.  Evidently, the Churchills could admire such a relative, even an enemy estranged from his country.

<a name="devonshire"><center><img src="images/key.gif"></center>

<H2 ALIGN="center">Dukes of Devonshire, 1694-Present,<br>and the Mitfords</H2>

<P><center><img src="images/key.gif"></center>

<P>The Dukes of Devonshire are noteworthy here for several reasons.  In origin the Dukedom goes along with the results of the Glorious Revolution (1688), which William Canvendish, who became the 1st Duke, had supported.  The Dukes continued in the tradition of supporting <a href="conserv.htm">Whig</a> government.  The Cavendish family, however, was important much earlier.  Part of their patrimony was Hardwick Hall, a great Elizabethan house, <img src="history/devon.gif" align=left>whose extensive windows, in a building that no longer needed to resemble a fortress, gave rise to the rhyme, "Hardwick Hall, more glass than wall."  This design was perhaps premature, with the English <a href="perifran.htm#protect">Civil War</a> coming.  The regular seat of the Dukes, however, came to be at Chatsworth -- which now lends it name to part of the <a href="perifran.htm#note-2">San Fernando Valley</a> -- the Chatsworth Hills appear as the backdrop of many <a href="apache.htm">Hollywood movies</a>.

<P>Subsequently, much of the interest of the Dukes of Devonshire involves their marriages and relatives.  In 2008, a movie, <I>The Duchess</I>, starring Keira Knightley and Ralph Fiennes, concerned the life of Georgiana Spencer, who married the 5th Duke.  Georgiana became famous at the time for her inovlvement in Whig politics, although, since women did not vote or hold office at the time, we get little idea of what this political activity would entail, apart from stump speechs, of which we get no more than a taste.  Otherwise, the movie deals with the Duke's cold nature, infidelities, and regard for her only as a means of producing an heir to the title.  Produce an heir she does, although ironically in the form of the 6th Duke who would have no children.  The succession passes to a collaterial line.

<P>However, one of Georgiana's daughters, also named Georgiana, has a daughter, Blanche, who marries the 7th Duke, reuniting the lines.  Her son, the 8th Duke, is then named "Spencer," from Georigian's own family.  Indeed, as a <a href="#marl">Spencer</a>, Georgiana is a distant cousin of Lady Diana Spencer, the Princess of Wales, who bore the present heirs apparent to the Throne of Britain.

<P>Meanwhile, the 5th Duke had had an illegitimate son.  After Georgiana died, he married the mother, Elizabeth Hervey, but did not legitimize the boy.  Perhaps that could not be done.  Like other noble bastards, however, Augustus Clifford went on to noble title and a distinguished career.  According to the movie, Georgiana spent the last years of her life in a sort of polite <I>m&eacute;nage &agrave; trois</I> with the Duke and this mistress.  The ideal Hollywood version of this would be if the women were also sleeping with each other, but the movie does not suggest such an arrangement.

<P><a name="costume">In 1897 there were great celebrations for the Diamond Jubilee of <a href="perifran.htm#hanover">Queen Victoria</a>.  A significant event was the costume ball given by the Duchess of Devonshire, at the time Louisa Frederica of Alten, wife of the 8th Duke, which was held at Devonshire House in London (<a href="rudwick.htm">Devon</a> itself was rather remote, and it is not clear that the Dukes of Devonshire ever had much to do with it).  The Duchess herself came dressed as Zenobia of <a href="romania.htm#palmyra">Palmyra</a>, although I am not clear what we would really know about the costume of a Queen of Palmyra, or what the Duchess actually wore -- probably some fantasy dress.  On better ground would have been the costume of (the recently widowed) Lady Randolph <a href="flanders.htm#marl">Churchill</a> (Jennie Jerome), the mother of Winston Churchill, who came dressed as the Roman Empress <a href="archon.htm#theodora">Theodora</a>, for whom we have several images of her in her own Imperial costume.  No less than three women dressed as <a href="hist-1.htm#text-9">Cleopatra</a> -- again probably with fantasy costumes.

<P>In recent history, the marriages are again prominent.  William Cavendish, Marquess of Hartington, son of the 10th Duke and the heir to Devonshire, married Kathleen Kennedy, the daughter of <a href="corrupt.htm#kennedy">Joseph Kennedy</a> and sister to future United States President <a href="presiden.htm#35">John F. Kennedy</a>.  This marriage began and ended tragically.  The Devonshires did not want a Catholic marriage, and the Kennedys did not want a Protestant one.  The Devonshires gave in, but Kathleen married against the wishes of her parents, and only her brother Joseph attended the wedding.  William, and Joseph, were then both killed in the War.  Kathleen herself died in a plane crash in 1948.

<P>The death of William meant that Devonshire would then pass to his brother Andrew, who meanwhile had married Deborah Mitford, the youngest of the famous, or infamous, Mitford sisters.<br clear=left>

<H3><a name="mitford"><I>The Mitfords</I></H3>

<P>The Mitfords were themselves a titled family, and the father of the Mitford sisters, David Mitford, the 2nd Baron Redesdale, was a first cousin, through his mother, of Winston Churchill's wife, Clementine.  In fact, Clementine may have been his half-sister, since rumor (no more) has it that Clementine was the natural daughter of David's father, Algernon Mitford, the 1st Baron.  The Mitford sisters were thus blood relatives, second cousins, and contemporaries, of all of Churchill's own children.

<P>Algernon Mitford himself had been a British diplomat in Japan at the time of the early <a href="sangoku.htm#modern">Meiji Era</a>.  In 1871 he published <I>Tales of Old Japan</I>, which first popularized in English stories like that of the <a href="sangoku.htm#asano">Forty-Seven Ronin</a>.  Thus, Nancy Mitford was not the first literary figure in the family.  Indeed, Algernon's great-grandfather, William Mitford (17441827), had been a historian and a friend of Edward Gibbon.  His <I>History of Greece</I> (five volumes, 1784-1810) was for many years the standard treatment of the subject.

<P>The curious childhood of the Mitford sisters (and their brother) is commemorated in the fiction of Nancy Mitford, particularly her books <I>The Pursuit of Love</I> [1945] and <I>Love in a Cold Climate</I> [1949].  The "Uncle Matthew" Radlett of these books is a thinly veiled recollection of her father David, something that was a bit disturbing to him and to the family.  However, the loud, <a href="elements.htm#humors">choleric</a>, bullying, eccentric Matthew, oddly enough, ends up being one of the most enjoyable, even appealing, and memorable characters in English fiction.  His dislike of foreigners, whom, with other miscreants, he calls "sewers" (apparently from the <a href="upan.htm">Tamil</a> word for "pig," which David had picked up in his youth in India -- he does also call people "swine"), now looks like something so quintessentially English, in the best 19th century sense, that the man might almost be John Bull himself.  His distrust of bankers is compounded when his daughter Linda wants to marry the son of a perfectly respectable English banker, who is nevertheless of <I>German surname and ancestry</I>.  His attitude, so obviously bigoted and irrational, nevertheless turns out to be the wisest judgment made by anyone involved.

<P>For, as it happens, these novels of Nancy's are both tragic love stories, none more so than <I>The Pursuit of Love</I>, where Linda's marriage fails and, having found the love of her life in a leader of the French Resistance in World War II ("Fabrice de Sauveterre"), she dies in childbirth while he dies at the hands of the Germans.  Since these two books cover much the same ground chronologically, it is not difficult to combine the stories together, as seems to have been done with all the film or video adaptations of them -- which then use the more unique title of <I>Love in a Cold Climate</I>.  I had been watching a BBC adaptation in 1982 -- including one night in <a href="ross/drives.htm#1982">Artesia</a>, New Mexico, while stranded for repairs to my <a href="ross/ross-2.htm#yoda">Volkswagen</a> -- and always remembered the moving moment when the narrator, Fanny, announces to the Radletts the true parentage of Linda's child.  This is a scene that is actually <I>not in</I> the book -- but it certainly calls out for expression in the action and the dialogue.

<P>Nancy continued writing books, which I have found not very good; and they don't even seem to be in print in the United States.

<P>The lives of the sisters were not without their own tragic love affairs.  Nancy herself had the affair with the leader of the French Resistance, in actuality one Colonel Gaston Palewski, who was on the staff of <a href="francia.htm#5rep">Charles de Gaulle</a>, the leader of the Free French.  Mitford even moved to Paris for his convenience, but that seems to be the theme of the relationship.  Palewski apparently had no intention of marrying her, and in fact eventually married another.  Nancy died perhaps without recovering from a hopeless and unrequited love.  Not as tragic as Linda's life but worse than any of Jane Austen's heroines.

<P><center><img src="history/mitford.gif"></center>

<P>Other sisters became famous for their political activities.  This went to extremes -- hence the "infamous" renown of the Mitford sisters.  Unity and Diana both became <I>personal friends</I> of <a href="francia.htm#third">Adolf Hitler</a>.  Unity did so by virtually stalking the man and meeting him by arranging to eat at his favorite restaurant in Munich when he was in town.  Her attitude then took the form of any star-struck infatuation with a public figure.  But Hitler also returned the interest.

<P>Diana Mitford's connection was a little different.  She became involved with Sir Oswald Mosley, who, after at first a promising military and political career, founded the British incarnation of the Fascist Party.  This never went over very well, and once the War started, he became "the most hated man in Britain."  Diana began an involvement with him as an adulterous affair, but then they married after his wife died.  Both of them were held in detention without charges, often under miserable and unhealth conditions, for much of the War.  As a cousin of Winston Churchill, Diana might have expected at least decent treatment, but then Churchill was inhibited by the danger of charges of favoritism for his relatives.  Eventually he did arrange both Diana and Oswald to be held together in more humane circumstances.  After the War, the Mosleys lived successful and happy lives, working for peace and European unity, as they said they always had even before the War.

<P>Unity, who curiously had been born in Canada, in a town actually called <a href="cognates.htm#sanskrit">Swastika</a>, of all things, fared worse.  When the War started, she tried to commit suicide by shooting herself in the head.  She did not die and regained sufficient health to live something of a normal life for a while, but she but did suffer permanent brain damage, was never quite the same, and died in 1948 from an infection that looks like a complication of the wound.  At death's door when she shot herself, Unity's care was personally arranged by Hitler, who visited her and then, when she was well enough, arranged for her repatriation home by way of Switzerland.

<P>Jessica Mitford's extremism went in the other direction, towards Communism.  After eloping with Esmond Romilly, and working with him among refugees from the Spanish Civil War, as fictionally recounted in Nancy's books, she and Esmond moved to the United States and even briefly ran a bar in Miami.  Esmond returned to Britain when the War started but then went missing in action.  Winston Churchill himself, visiting the White House, personally told Jessica the intelligence that meant Esmond was unlikely to be found alive.

<P>Remaining in America, Jessica and her second husband, a lawyer, then became active members of the <a href="rand.htm#essential">Communist Party</a>.  Grieved over Unity, with whom she had been close, Jessica subsequently had difficulty becoming reconciled to Diana.  After some adventures in the 1950's because of her Communism, Jessica settled down to an active, productive, and happy life.  She apparently was not privy to the activities of the "underground" Communist Party and so did not know that the operation was funded and directed from Moscow.  The ignorance and naivet&eacute; of people like her, of course, was used by the Party as a defense of its <I>bona fides</I> in American politics.

<P>What happened to the Mitfords with Hitler is a matter of some considerable historical interest, especially in the <I>moral</I> evaluation of a person like Adolf Hitler.  All the Mitfords were intelligent, cultured, and well educated -- despite the eccentricities and irregularities of what was actually home schooling.  It is a simple matter now to think of a person like Adolf Hitler as ignorant, stupid, brutish, violent, and cruel.  Yet people who met him and even knew him over an extended period often found him well read, cultured, charming, articulate, and appealing.  This is really hard to believe now, but there is considerable evidence that Hitler could be personally very agreeable, if he wanted.

<P>Oddly enough, in the Mitford circle, it was Oswald Mosley who found Hitler the most resistable.  Mosley's idea of Fascism owed more to <a href="francia.htm#italministers">Benito Mussolini</a>, with whom he was much better acquainted and more comfortable.  Indeed, the familiar figure of Mussolini now, of an ignorant and bombastic buffoon (like Hitler), and however ridiculous his public persona, contradicts the impression of Mussolini as literate, articulate -- an author of pre-World War I note -- and charming to many people who knew him.

<P>The danger of people like Hitler and Mussolini is of a different sort than we might think.  Usually, we expect that those who are evil may succeed in <I>concealing</I> their true feelings and intentions, but that once we know them well, we will not be deceived.  But the case may actually be that the <I>true character</I> of the wicked contains good as well as evil.  People think that <I>knowing the good</I> in someone means that they are basically good, but this is a mistake.  It is a common error, and reasonable in its wide acceptance, but it is nevertheless wrong.  Those with good in them may do much evil, or even be mostly evil themselves (e.g. <a href="starwars.htm">Darth Vader</a>?).

<P>Thus, Winston Churchill, who never met Hitler, knew what he was about.  And he was right.  On the other hand, Traudl Junge (19202002), who was Hitler's personal secretary for much of the War (we see her in <I>Downfall</I> [<I>Undergang</I>], 2005), even at the end of her life said that Hitler was <I>the best boss she ever had</I>.  Hitler apparently was kind and considerate to people under him in relatively powerless positions.  He stormed and raged at generals, but not at female secretaries.  This is not what we expect from the powerful and megalomaniacal.  Napoleon stormed and raged at anyone.

<P>Thus, when Neville Chamberlain met Hitler, respected him, and believed him, was he just a fool?  Perhaps.  Or perhaps he was taken in by something that was not actually a deception, but something about Hitler that could deceive even the Elect, just because there was something about it that was genuine.

<P>The experience of the Mitfords adds to this picture.  After Unity, Diana, and their brother Thomas got excited about Germany and its Leader, they persuaded their parents to visit.  David, from a distance, had no good impression of Hitler -- certainly as we might suspect from "Uncle Matthew," or from a cousin of Winston Churchill.  Yet both parents were charmed by Hitler in person.  With David, this impression did not survive the beginning of the War; but it was durable with Lady Redesdale, the girls' mother.  She persisted in believing that Mr. Churchill was responsible for the War (just as Hitler said, although Churchill was not even Prime Minister until the Germans invaded Norway).  Herr Hitler was far too nice to have intended war.

<P>The disagreement between the parents became so severe that it destroyed their marriage.  Nothing was ever the same, even though David lived all the way until 1958 (despite having lost a <I>lung</I> in the <I>Boer War</I>).  Thus, the toll that the War took on the Mitfords was not just the deaths, of the brother Thomas or the suicide attempt of Unity, but of a moral division brought about, not so much by ideology, although Diana seems rather confused in that respect, but by personal judgment -- the defective judgment of character on a personal level.

<P>Given the cartoonish historical image of Hitler, it is now hard to imagine how his character could have appealed to anyone, but apparently it did.  In one way it shouldn't be surprising:  &nbsp;Satan, as the Father of Lies, has often been portrayed as polite, urbane, appealing, and persuasive.  True, we might think of Satan's appeal as deceptive and concealing his true intentions; but then the strength of Milton's portrayal of Satan in <I>Paradise Lost</I> is generally considered to rest on a sympathetic presentation of his true motives and desires.  The most dangerous Satan is the one that we find attractive on his own terms.

<P>Meanwhile, the marriage of Deborah and her future as the Duchess of Devonshire look like small potatoes in comparison to the issues in the rest of the family.  But it is comforting in its own way.  The last surviving sister, Deborah apparently enjoyed a long, happy, and successful marriage, to finally pass away on 24 September 2014, aged 94.  In the early years, one of the challenges for the Devonshires was the death taxes, the estate duties, that fell on their wealth at the death of the 10th Duke in 1950.  Such taxes, of course, were designed by the post-War socialists of the Labour Party to break up great concentrations of wealth.  They were under the mistaken impression that all noble families were fabulously wealthy, or that mere land necessarily meant great wealth in the sense of liquid income.

<P>The Mitfords, indeed, had suffered from want of money for years, which is why the girls grew up in at least three different houses, unlike the fictionalized story we get in Nancy's books.  The 11th Duke and Deborah could easily have lost all their land and houses through paying the taxes.  They adopted the strategy of sacrificing everything to save Chatsworth.  Thus in 1956 Hardwick Hall went to the government and has been kept by the National Trust since 1959.  Chatsworth was saved, generates adequate income through tourism, and was still the residence of Deborah, as the Dowager Duchess after the death of her husband, and her son, the 12th Duke, and his family.

<P>Deborah wrote, or co-wrote, several books and descriptions of the House.  Meanwhile, the Government has sobered up a bit and realized that its policies could result in all the great houses of Britain, the "treasure houses," either becoming a burden on the public purse or getting demolished.  Now what we often see, as at <a href="#marl">Blenheim</a>, are houses where the family still lives but that nevertheless have become great tourist attractions.  National treasures that can at least pay their own way.

<P>Like "Uncle Matthew" with his insular prejudices, Deborah was found in the autumn of her days living a quintessentially English life:  &nbsp;walking over green grass covered hills, with her dog, among the sheep, feeding the chickens in the morning, Chatsworth House in the distance.
