<P>The <I>Euthyphro</I>, <img src="images/greek/euthyphr.gif" align=middle>, is one of the short dialogues by which Plato commemorated Socrates's technique and manner in questioning people.  The structure of the dialogue, which is typical for Plato's Socratic dialogues, is reflected in the following table of contents.  Note the difference between the three standard questions of Socrates and the many proposed answers, with occasional digressions, in response to the third one.  The identifying numbers given for the text are not the page numbers of the Hackett edition but the numbers and letters in the margin, which are standard for all editions of Plato.<p>

<ul>
<li>As Euthyphro encounters Socrates outside the courthouse, the dialogue begins with ordinary conversational small talk.<p>

<li>2a.  Euthyphro, whom we do not know about otherwise (see Grube's footnote), greets Socrates with "What's new?"  This is pretty much what it says in Greek, <img src="images/greek/what.gif" align=middle> <I>T&iacute; ne&oacute;teron?</I> -- although <I>ne&oacute;teron</I> literally means "newer" or "later."<p>

<li><a name="academy">2a.</a>  Euthyphro mentions seeing Socrates in the <B>Lyceum</B>, <img src="images/greek/lyceum.gif" align=middle>.  In Socrates's day the Lyceum was an area outside the walls of Athens that had an athletic field (a gymnasium, <img src="images/greek/gymnasiu.gif" align=middle>, <I>gymnasion</I> -- meaning a "place for nudity") and possibly a bath.  Later, in 335, it became the site for the school of <B>Aristotle</B>.

<P><blockquote>After the death of Socrates in 399, Plato had travelled a bit, and then, on returning to Athens, founded a school in a grove of trees, which may also have had an athletic field, just outside the Dipylon Gate of Athens.  The grove had been named after an Olympic athlete, <I>Akad&ecirc;mos</I>, and was consequently was known as the <B>Akad&eacute;meia</B>, <img src="images/greek/academy.gif" align=middle>.  This became the name of Plato's school, the <B>Academy</B>, spawning modern words like, indeed, "academy," "academic," etc.  The school was founded perhaps in 387.  It was finally closed in 529 AD, when the Roman Emperor <a href="hist-1.htm#theano">Justinian</a> did so as part of his campaign to stamp out paganism.  That would add up to 915 years, a pretty good run, longer than most of the universities of Europe -- though the al-Azhar University in Cairo, associated with the al-Azhar Mosque, was founded in 970 AD by the Fatimid Caliph <a href="islam.htm#fatimid">al-Mu'izz</a>, so it is now 1028 years old.  However, there appears to be an hiatus in the history of the Academy.  In 86 BC, Athens had adhered to the cause of Mithridates VI, the King of <a href="hist-1.htm#pontus">Pontus</a>, and the Roman general Sulla took and sacked the city, destroying, according to Plutarch, even the groves round about, including the Academy.  The Scholarch of the Academy, Philo of Larissa, had fled to Rome when the War began in 88 BC and never returned.  Philo's student, Antiochus of Ascalon, did afterwards return to Athens and began teaching, but not at the site of the Academy.  Cicero studied under him at Athens and reported that the site of the Academy was vacant.  But at some point, the Academy seems to have been revived, perhaps not until Athens became the focus of <a href="hist-1.htm#late">Neoplatonism</a> in the 5th century.  In modern Athens there is an old monastery in the area where the Academy would have been -- it may be on the actual site.

<P>Aristotle was Plato's best student at the Academy and was even known as the "mind of the Academy."  When Plato died in 347, Aristotle thought he would become the head of the School.  Instead, the office went to one of Plato's nephews.  Aristotle was a little put out by this and left.  After visiting a friend, who was then executed by the Persians, and marrying his daughter, Aristotle went home to Macedonia in 345, where his father, a court physician, got him a job as tutor to the son of the King.  The King was Philip II, and the son would turn out to be <a href="hist-1.htm#monarch">Alexander the Great</a>.  Just what Aristotle taught Alexander, or what they had to say to each other at all, was recorded by neither of them and remains one of the tantalizing unknowns of history.  When Alexander went off to conquer Persia, Aristotle then returned to Athens to found his own school in the Lyceum.  This became one of the established schools of the <a href="hist-1.htm#hellen">Hellenistic Period</a>, though it does not seem to have lasted beyond the Hellenistic age.  Although members of the Academy were simply "Academics," members of the Lyceum were called "Peripatetics," which meant, and still means, those who "walk around," which evidently is the way that Aristotle lectured.</blockquote><p>

<li>2a.  Euthyphro mentions that he is meeting Socrates outside "the king-archon's court."  The "king-archon," <img src="images/greek/basileus.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/archon.gif" align=middle>, was one of the major officials of Athens (a group of whom were the "<a href="archon.htm">archons</a>," = rulers -- a word familiar to some from the <a href="trek.htm">Star Trek</a> episode, "Return of the Archons").  He was called the "king" because he discharged what had been the <I>religious</I> duties of the old kings.  One duty was to preside over court cases with a religious dimension.  With Socrates that is obvious, since he is accused of impiety (not honoring the gods of the city).  Euthyphro is prosecuting a murder case, but it turns out that murder cases have a religious dimension because they involve the shedding of blood, which is religiously <a href="newotto.htm">polluting</a>, as Euthyphro later notes himself (4c).  The foundations of the king-archon's court were discovered some years ago next to the subway tunnel that presently forms one boundary of the excavated area of the Agora (the marketplace) in Athens.<p>

<li>2c-3a.  An example of Socrates's irony.  He certainly does not think that his accuser, Meletus, will "become a source of great blessings for the city."<p>

<li>3a.  Euthyphro misses the irony.  But he seems to regard Socrates as a local institution, "the heart of the city."<p>

<li>3b.  Euthyphro looks like the kind of person, making his prophecies, who gets laughed at in the Assembly.  This doesn't sound good.<p>

<li><a name="academy2">3d.  "...my liking for people..."  Since Socrates spends his time in the most public and crowded places in Athens, like the marketplace (the Agora), asking people questions and drawing crowds, it is not surprising that he thinks of himself as liking people.  This may be contrasted with <B>Plato</B>, who only taught at the Academy, outside the walls of Athens, who didn't let just anyone into the Academy.  Over the door of the Academy a sign famously said, <img src="images/greek/academ-5.gif" align=middle>, "Without geometry, do not enter" -- although such a sign is attested no earlier than <a href="hist-1.htm#impetus">John Philoponus</a> in the 6th Century (with other versions given later).  Consistent with this, however, according to the <a href="plato.htm"><I>Republic</I></a>, Plato didn't think that just anyone should be <I>allowed</I> to study philosophy.  One might conclude that Plato <B>didn't</B> have much of a "liking for people."<p>

<li>3e. "...the outcome is not clear except to you prophets."  A bit of a challenge here to Euthyphro, who has boasted that "I have foretold nothing that did not happen" (3c).  If he can "foretell the future" so well, why not predict the outcome of Socrates's case?  "Perhaps it will come to nothing," however, is the strongest prophecy that he can make.<p>

</ul>
<li><H2><a name="two">First Question:  "What are you doing?" (3e-4e)</a></H2>
<ul>

<li>3e.  "What is your case [<img src="images/greek/dike.gif" align=middle>]..?"  The start of the dialogue proper.  Socrates's characteristic first question is simply to ask people what they are doing.  This is Socrates as the opposite of an armchair philosopher.  With Euthyphro, he has already mentioned that he is prosecuting someone, but Socrates asks again whether he is the defendant or the prosecutor.  It is noteworthy that the word here for a legal case, <img src="images/greek/dike.gif" align=middle>, <I>dike</I>, is simply the word for <a href="domain.htm#text">justice</a>.  In Chinese, as we see in the <a href="ross/dee.htm">Judge Dee</a> stories, a legal case is a <img src="images/koan.gif" align=middle> or just an <img src="images/an.gif" align=middle>, which means a judge's table, rather the way "bench" can be used to mean a court in English.  In turn, <img src="images/hiero/gong.gif" align=middle> means "public" or "official"; and <img src="images/koan.gif" align=middle> itself can be (in Japanese) a <I>k&ocirc;an</I> or puzzle question used in <a href="divebomb.htm">Zen Buddhism</a>.<p>

<li><a name="father">3e-4b.  It turns out that Euthyphro is prosecuting a murder case against his own father.  This is shocking to Socrates.  It would still be disturbing enough to us, where children turning against their parents sounds like something from Nazi Germany, Soviet Russia, or the War on the Drugs (where the DARE campaign has reportedly encouraged children to inform on their parents).  It is <I>more</I> disturbing to Socrates, because the basic unit of Greek religion is the home and the household.  The household hearth does not exist just for warmth and cooking; it is an altar, an altar to the household gods and especially the ancestors, whose misery in the Underworld is ameliorated by offerings from the living (similar beliefs were common in India before the idea of reincarnation caught on).  The father of the family is thus the family <B>priest</B>.  Roman Law gave the <I>pater familias</I> the virtual power of life and death over all members of the family.  Turning against one's father is thus like turning against one's religion, and a major act of impiety -- rather like Arjuna's grief at the possibility of killing his teacher in the <a href="gita.htm#teacher">Bhagavad Gita</a>, or, more specifically, like contravening the reverence for parents, the "filial piety," <img src="images/hiero/v-piety.gif" align=middle>, required by Confucius (cf. <a href="confuciu.htm#family"><I>Analects</I></a>, XIII:18).  This is why the issue of the <I>Euthyphro</I> becomes piety.<p>

<li><a name="pollution">4b-4e.  Euthyphro loftily responds that one should simply punish injustice regardless of who does it.  "The pollution is the same," <img src="images/greek/miasma.gif" align=middle>, refers to the <a href="newotto.htm">religious pollution</a> of the spilling of blood.  However, we then get the details of the case, and it looks pretty weak.  The victim, a servant, was a murderer himself, having killed a family slave "in drunken anger."  Euthyphro's father then ties him up, throws him in a ditch, and sends a messenger to find out what to do about him.  The messenger does not go to the police, because there are no police, nor to the district attorney, because there is no district attorney either.  The messenger goes to a priest -- actually an "exegete," <img src="images/greek/exegetes.gif" align=middle>, an "interpreter" of oracles, dreams, omens, and sacred custom -- doubtless because of the religious dimension, again, of the spilling of blood.  But, with no telephones, it takes a while for the messenger to go and return.  The prisoner, neglected, meanwhile dies.  In modern law, the father might be liable for some kind of negligent homicide, but in Greek law and practice that would have been the end of it -- had Euthyphro not decided to prosecute his own father himself.<p>

</ul>
<li><H2><a name="three">Second Question:  "Why are you doing it?" (4e-5a)</a></H2>
<ul>

<li>4e-5a.  The second question characteristic of Socrates is just to ask why a person is doing what they are doing.  The answer will be of the form, "I am doing this because it is [value term]."  The value term may be "good," "just," "virtuous," etc.  In this case, Socrates doesn't need to ask the question because Euthyphro volunteers that people's "ideas of the divine attitude to piety and impiety are wrong, Socrates."  This is a red flag to Socrates.  He asks if Euthyphro has no fear of acting impiously.  Euthyphro answers loftily again that "Euthyphro would not be superior to the majority of men" if he did not know all about it.  This gives us piety as the subject of discussion.<p>

</ul>
<li><H2><a name="four">Third Question:  "What is Piety?" (5a-15c)</a></H2>
<ul>
<li><H3><a name="four2">Ironic Pose:  "I must become your pupil." (5a-5d)</a></H3>
<ul>

<li>5a-5c.  Before asking the main question, Socrates sets himself up as Euthyphro's student.  After all, if Socrates doesn't know anything about this, but Euthyphro says he does, what would be more fitting?  Of course, this is an ironic pose:  Socrates probably does not expect, as we do not, that Euthyphro can answer his questions.  We might even consider this dishonest of Socrates; but he does give Euthyphro the benefit of the doubt, he does take him at his word, or, we might say, he is ready to give him enough rope to hang himself.  Either way, if Euthyphro <I>can</I> answer the questions, Socrates will have to be his student indeed.  He will also be able, as he says, to get Euthyphro to defend him at his trial!  Or get Meletus to charge Euthyphro with "corrupting" older men, like his father and Socrates!<p>

<li>5c-5d.  The question, when it comes, turns out to be two.  "What kind of thing do you say godliness [<img src="images/greek/piousn.gif" align=middle>, "<a href="newotto.htm#note-0">the pious</a>"] and ungodliness [<img src="images/greek/impiousn.gif" align=middle>, "the impious"] are," is the main question, but Socrates immediately provides Euthyphro with a way out by asking if the pious is not "the same and alike in every action."  Euthyphro would not have to give a single answer to the main question if he answers the latter that the pious is, indeed, <B>not</B> the same and alike.  This would derail the questioning for a while, but Euthyphro does not take advantage of that avenue.  He answers the second question first, that "most certainly" the pious and the impious present us "with one form or appearance."<p>

<li>5d.  There is some misdirection with the translation here.  Grube gives us "one form or appearance" for <I>m&iacute;an tin&agrave; id&eacute;an</I>, <img src="images/greek/mia-acc.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/tis-acc.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/idea-acc.gif" align=middle>, "some one idea" (in the accusative, while the nominative would be <I>m&iacute;a tis id&eacute;a</I>, <img src="images/greek/mia-nom.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/tis-nom.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/idea-w.gif" align=middle>), which is then footnoted with a discussion about Plato's terminology and the theory of the Forms  -- <I>id&eacute;ai</I>, <img src="images/greek/ideai-w.gif" align=middle> (singular <I>id&eacute;a</I>, <img src="images/greek/idea-w.gif" align=middle>) or <I>e&iacute;d&ecirc;</I>, <img src="images/greek/eide-w.gif" align=middle> (singular <I>e&icirc;dos</I>, <img src="images/greek/eidosw.gif" align=middle>).  However, Plato's theory of Forms is not part of Socrates's thinking in the <I>Euthyphro</I>, and this is a distracting and out of place translation and discussion.  Since the word "idea," used by Socrates in Greek, has been borrowed into modern languages and English, with a meaning recognizably similar to the original, there is no good reason to translate it at all.  Socrates is asking for the "idea" of piety, which can still mean a request for its meaning.  "Form," however, does not suggest meaning, unless we are aware of conventions in translating Plato.<p>
</ul>

<li><H3><a name="five">First Definition:  "The Pious is what I am doing." (5d-6d)</a></H3>
<ul>

<li>5d.  Euthyphro's first definition is simply to cite his own actions.  This could be called an "ostensive" definition, to point to examples of what is to be defined, but Euthyphro does not give enough examples for that to work, and it isn't what Socrates really wants anyway.  The failure of a person to give a <I>general</I> definition at first is common in Socrates's investigations.<p>

<li><a name="zeus">5e-6a.  Euthyphro now launches off into a speech citing Greek mythology as a justification for his prosecution of his father, referring to the belief of people that <img src="images/greek/zeus-1.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/zeus-2.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/zeus-3.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/zeus-4.gif" align=middle>, "Zeus is the best and most just of the gods."  The incidents are from Hesiod's <I>Theogony</I> (the "Birth of the gods").  <B>Ouranos</B>, "Father Heaven," who was the son as well as the husband of <B>Gaia</B>, "Mother Earth," didn't like the children she was giving birth to (the <B>Titans</B>), so he refused to let them be born, forcing them back into her womb.  <img src="images/gods.gif" align=right><a name="text-1">She didn't like this too much</a>, and so she equipped the eldest son, <B>Kronos</B>, with a scythe (a long pole with a wicked blade for harvesting grain -- it must have been very crowded in her womb!).  When Ouranos next approached Gaia for sex, Kronos cut off his genitals [<a href="#note-1">1</a>].  Thus Kronos became king of the gods [<a href="#note-2">2</a>].  But there was then a ominous prophecy:  Kronos would be overthrown by his son just like his father.  Kronos dealt with this by eating his children as his wife <B>Rhea</B> gave birth to them.  Rhea tired of this and saved her youngest son, <B>Zeus</B>, by wrapping a stone in swaddling clothes and giving that to Kronos.  One wonders about the diet of the Titans when Kronos eats a stone, clothes and all, and doesn't notice it isn't a baby!  Rhea then raised Zeus in a cave on Crete.  He grew up and married his cousin <B>Metis</B>, who then suggested giving Kronos something that would make him <I>throw up</I> the other children.  They did, and he did; and, after growing up, evidently unharmed, in their father's stomach, Zeus's siblings joined with him in overthrowing Kronos and those Titans that sided with him.  They were then imprisoned in <B>Tartarus</B>, the deepest part of the Underworld.  Zeus's brother <B>Hades</B> (or Pluto) took the Underworld to rule, and <B>Poseidon</B> the Sea, while Zeus himself ruled all from <B>Mt. Olympus</B> -- the highest point in Greece at 9,550 ft. (but not as tall as <B>Baldy</B>, <a href="ross/calif.htm">Mt. San Antonio</a>, which is visible from the city of Los Angeles on a clear day, at 10,064 ft.).  Only one problem remained:  a prophecy that Zeus would be overthrown by a son of Metis as his father and grandfather had been!  Taking measures one step further, Zeus actually <B>devoured</B> the pregnant Metis!  Although the goddess <B>Athena</B>, the patroness of the city of Athens, then sprang from his forehead, this took care of the prophecy -- Athena was rather like a son, born in armor, but she wasn't.  No prophecy then applied to the sons of Zeus's new wife, his sister <B>Hera</B>.<p>

<li>6a-6b.  We now learn that Socrates does not believe stories about violence, mutilation, war, and battles among the gods.  This is Socrates breaking with the <a href="greek.htm#morally">fifth characteristic</a> of mytho-poeic thought.  He is willing to suspend his disbelief, having become a student of Euthyphro, but he still expresses his astonishment.<p>

<li><a name="parthenon"><img src="images/greek/athena.jpg" align=right>6c.  "Representations of which the robe of the goddess is adorned..."  The "goddess," of course, is Athena.  A great statue of <B>Athena Parthenos</B>, <img src="images/greek/athena.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/partheno.gif" align=middle>, Athena "the Virgin," was contained in the <B>Parthenon</B>, <img src="images/greek/parthenn.gif" align=middle> (see discussion of the word "Parthenos" <a href="greek.htm#love">here</a>).  We know roughly what the statue looked like, in ivory and gold, because of three small Roman copies.  We might not have known, however, that the statue had a robe if not for a reference like this.  The robe was cleaned (or replaced) every four years and then carried back up to the Acropolis in a great procession, as part of the <I>Panathenaia</I> festival.  Not only the robe, however, was adorned with mythological scenes.  The Parthenon itself was decorated with sculpted figures and reliefs, done by the great sculptor <B>Phidias</B>, <img src="images/greek/phidias.gif" align=middle>.  An inner continuous relief, the <I>frieze</I>, depicted the Panathenaia itself.  When the Greeks converted to Christianity, the Parthenon became a church, dedicated, as we might imagine, to the Virgin Mary, called the <I>Atheniotissa</I>.  There were stories that the sancturary, or the marble, of the building glowed with a supernational light, and it became an object of pilgrimage.  When the <a href="turkia.htm#mehmet">Turks</a> arrived in 1456, they turned the church into a mosque but also, unfortunately, later used it to store gunpowder.

</table>

In a Venetian attack on the city in 1687, a cannon ball came through the building and hit the gunpowder.  Thus, 2133 years after its foundation was laid (in 447 BC, with money misappropriated from the defense contributions of the League of Delos), the Parthenon was blown to pieces.  For images of the modern Acropolis, see section in the <a href="apology.htm#twelve"><I>Apology</I></a>.  In 1801 the British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, <B>Lord Elgin</B>, asked if he could remove some of the sculptures from the wreckage.  With Turkish permission, much of the decoration of the Parthenon was then shipped to London between 1803 and 1812.  Those sculptures, now called the "Elgin Marbles," are still housed in the <B>British Museum</B>.  After Greece won independence from Turkey in 1830, the Greeks began requesting the return of the marbles.  British governments have consistently refused, including, most recently, the Labor government of <a href="perifran.htm#ERII">Tony Blair</a>. Anyone who wishes to inspect all that remains of the Parthenon, therefore, must travel to London as well as to Athens.  In Athens itself, on the other hand, some of the original marble on the Acropolis has been replaced with fiberglass copies, so that the original stone can be housed in museums away from the acidic properties of modern Athenian smog.  Now, however, reconstruction of the Parthenon itself has begun, using marble from the original quarries.

<li><H3><a name="six">Second Definition:  "The Pious is what is dear to the gods." (6c-8b)</a></H3>
<ul>

<li>6c-6d.  "...at leisure some other time."  Socrates is not really interested in Euthyphro's expertise on mythology. He now brings to Euthyphro's attention the fact that the first definition, "What I am doing now," did not really answer the question.<p>

<li><a name="universal">6e.  "...this idea itself."</a>  Again, we have our problem with the translation, with "form" translating <img src="images/greek/idea-w.gif" align=middle>, <I>idea</I>.  Also, the imagery that Socrates then uses reminds us of the etymology of the word <I>idea</I>.  Socrates says that he wants the idea, "so that I may look upon it..."  Since <I>idea</I> comes from the same root (<a href="cognates.htm"><I>*wid</I></a>) as part of the verb "to see," <img src="images/greek/see03.gif" align=middle>, <I>e&iacute;don</I> ("<a href="system.htm#note-3">I saw</a>"), we may note the connection with Socrates's metaphor of "looking" and the meaning of the word.  Another part of the verb "to see," <img src="images/greek/see05.gif" align=middle>, <I>o&icirc;da</I>, meaning "I have seen," can also be used to actually mean "I know."<p>

<li>6e.  "...and using it as a model..."  "Model" here is <img src="images/greek/paradigm.gif" align=middle>, <I>par&aacute;deigma</I>, a word that is still used ("<B>paradigm</B>") to mean a model or pattern.  Although Aristotle says that Socrates did not dissociate the "idea" from the object, as did Plato, here we do have a distinction between the general meaning, treated as a separate "model," and the individual things which embody the meaning, "any actions of yours or another's that is of that kind..."<p>

<li>7a.  "What is dear to the gods is pious..."  Now Euthyphro gives a general definition, to Socrates's delight ("Splendid").  The overall irony of the dialogue is that after "manifold wanderings," as <a href="kant.htm">Kant</a> would say, we find Euthyphro returning to the same definition in the end, at 15b.<p>

<li>7b.  "We have also stated..."  Now, Euthyphro's problem is going to be that, as we have already learned, he thinks that the gods fight among themselves and have, we might say, serious disagreements.  This will be fatal for his definition, since the same things would be loved by some gods, and so be pious, but be hated by other gods, and so be impious.   This may indeed be an artifact of most polytheisms, in which the pious worship of some gods may entail the impious neglect of others.  <a href="god.htm#euripides"><B>Euripides</B></a> wrote a play about something of the sort, <I>Hippolytus</I>, in which the reverence and dedication of Hippolytus for the virgin goddess <B>Artemis</B> draws down the wrath and vengeance of the goddess of love, <B>Aphrodite</B>.<P>

<li>7b.  Socrates, however, does not go directly for the kill.  First, he asks a deeper question, as he often does:  If the gods disagree about things, <B>why</B> do they disagree?<p>

<li><a name="opposites">7c-7d.  "What subject of difference..."  Euthyphro cannot say why the gods would disagree, so Socrates suggests that the subjects of difference are, "the just [<img src="images/greek/dikaios.gif" align=middle>] and the unjust [<img src="images/greek/unjust.gif" align=middle>], the beautiful [<img src="images/greek/beauty.gif" align=middle>] and the ugly [<img src="images/greek/ugly.gif" align=middle>], the good [<img src="images/greek/good.gif" align=middle>] and the bad [<img src="images/greek/bad.gif" align=middle>]."  This gives us a nice list of such value terms as would constitute <img src="images/greek/the-fem.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/anthropi.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/and-te.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/kai.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/politike.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/virtue.gif" align=middle>, "the human and social [actually, <I>political</I>] kind of excellence [/virtue]" of the <a href="apology.htm#excellence"><I>Apology</I></a> (20b) [Grube, p. 26].  These are what the Sophists claimed to teach, and what Socrates actually asks his questions about, what, "when we are unable to come to a satisfactory decision, you and I and other men become hostile to each other whenever we do?"  As it happens, people still become hostile over these issues, as with recent debate over "<a href="capit-2.htm">affirmative action</a>".  It is noteworthy that the Loeb Classical Library edition of the <I>Euthyphro</I> [Plato, Volume I, <I>Euthyphro, Apology, Crito, Phaedo, Phaedrus</I>, translated by Harold North Fowler, Harvard, 1914, p.27] translates "just and unjust" as "right and wrong."  This goes back to what I have discussed <a href="domain.htm#text">elsewhere</a>, that Greek tends to use <img src="images/greek/dikaios.gif" align=middle> where we would say "right."  Similarly, the Loeb edition translates "beautiful and ugly" as "noble and disgraceful."  This is based on the frequent <I>moral</I> sense of <img src="images/greek/beauty.gif" align=middle>.  The opposite, <img src="images/greek/ugly.gif" align=middle>, shares in this and so can mean "shameful" (etc.) as well as "ugly."  An interesting sense of <img src="images/greek/beauty.gif" align=middle> is found in the quote <a href="good.htm">here</a>, where we get <img src="images/greek/pankalon.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/ergon.gif" align=middle>, <I>p&aacute;gkalon &eacute;rgon</I>, the "all-beautiful work," whiih nevertheless gets translated "excellent aim."  See issues about these concepts <a href="domain.htm#beauty">here</a>.
<p>

<li>7e-8a.  "...according to your argument..."  If Euthyphro thinks that the gods disagree, then they must disagree about what is "just, beautiful, ugly, good, and bad."  They each love what they think good and hate what they think bad, and so the same things will come to be loved by some gods and hated by others.  "And the same things would be both pious and impious."<p>

<li>8a-8b.  So Euthyphro's definition is no definition, as Socrates says, "I did not ask what same thing is both pious and impious."  Prosecuting his father may have been pleasing to Zeus, who overthrew and imprisoned his father, but not pleasing to Ouranos or Kronos, who were both victims of their sons.  Euthyphro's actions would thus be hated by the older gods, even if loved by Zeus.<p>

</ul>
<li><H3><a name="seven">Correction:  "The gods don't disagree about penalizing injustice." (8b-9a)</a></H3>
<ul>

<li>8b.  "No gods would differ..."  Euthyphro now wants to fix up his definition to avoid the difficulty exposed to Socrates.  His argument will be, in general, that the gods will <B>not</B> differ in the actual murder case, even if they <I>might</I> differ about the piety of a son prosecuting his father.<p>

<li>8b.  "Whoever has killed anyone unjustly should pay the penalty."  Unfortunately, the principle that Euthyphro proposes as what the gods would agree upon is far too general to encompass the specifics of the case he wants to make against his father.<p>

<li>8c-8e.  "Have you ever heard..."  Socrates points out that <B>no one</B> would disagree with the principle Euthyphro proposes.  Euthyphro tries to disagree, saying that defendants will "say anything" to avoid punishment.  But Socrates points out that they do not <B>deny</B> that the wrongdoer must be punished.  Instead, "they deny doing wrong."  They "disagree as to who the wrongdoer is..."  Thus, O.J. Simpson did not walk into court, admit that he killed two people, and then deny that he should be punished.  He denied that he had done any killing.  Similarly, <a href="presiden.htm#42">Bill Clinton</a> denied ever lying under oath, even though he had to argue, to sustain the "legal correctness" of his answers, that oral sex was not sex and that he wasn't sure what "alone" and "is" meant.<p>
</ul>

<li><H3><a name="eight">Question:  "What do the gods agree on in the case?" (9a-9b)</a></H3>
<ul>

<li>9a-9b.  "...what proof..."  Now we hear the last that we will <B>ever hear</B> in the <I>Euthyphro</I> about the actual murder case.  Socrates asks <I>specifically</I> why <I>all</I> the gods would "consider that man to have been killed unjustly who became a murderer while in your service, was bound by the master of his victim, and died in his bonds before the one who bound him found out from the seers what was to be done with him..." and why it is right for a son to prosecute his father on behalf of the dead murderer.  Euthyphro has no answer to this, and it now appears that he has given no thought to the actual <B>murder case</B> at all.  It looks like all Euthyphro has prepared for court is his argument from Greek mythology why it is pious for a son to prosecute his father.  He probably will enjoy shocking people with his outrageous behavior and argument.  But when it comes to the actual case, Euthyphro will not be able to say why his murdering servant died unjustly.<P>

</ul>

<li><H3><a name="nine">Third Definition:  "The Pious is what is loved by all the gods." (9c-10a)</a></H3>
<ul>

<li>9c-9e.  Socrates isn't all that interested in the murder case anyway.  He wants to pursue the definition of piety.  Also, since Socrates himself does not believe that that gods disagree about anything, we might wonder if the "loved by the gods" definition would be satisfactory to him once we toss out the embarrassing features of Greek mythology.  Now Socrates makes that correction, "I will not insist on this point..."  He will stipulate that the pious is what is loved by <B>all the gods</B>, while, if the gods disagree about anything, Socrates will disregard those matters.  Euthyphro likes that fine, but, of course, Socrates has something else in mind.<p>

<P>Euthyphro is given an extraordinary chance to bail out.  He could just tell Socrates, "Just accept what I say and stop asking these questions!"   This is always a typical move of those claiming authority, to shut off debate and questioning.  Euthyphro, however, is naively honest and supposes that he can handle whatever Socrates will throw at him.  Eventually he will run away, but he will never admit to Socrates that he cannot answer his questions.<p>
</ul>

<li><H3><a name="ten">Question:  "Is the Pious loved because it is Pious, or Pious because it is loved?" (10a-11b)</a></H3>
<ul>

<li>10a.  <img src="images/pious.gif" align="right">Now we come to what is historically the most significant question in the <I>Euthyphro</I>.   Socrates wonders whether the love of the gods is even <B>relevant</B> to the meaning of piety, so he asks:  "Is the pious loved by the gods because it is pious, or is it pious because it is loved by the gods?"  This is a question about causality.  On the one side are the gods, in the act of loving.  On the other side is piety.  Is piety <B>caused</B> by the <B>loving</B> of the gods, or is the love of the gods itself <B>caused</B> by the <B>nature</B> of piety.  In the former case, the pious is <B>whatever</B> the gods love, for whatever reason.  Indeed, the gods must love things arbitrarily, for no reasons; for if the gods love something for some good reason, then the nature of the thing makes it <B>worthy of love</B> and the gods must merely recognize the objective <B>value</B> of the thing.  This is a question that becomes of increasing theological importance in the future.  That is because it can be <B>generalized</B> into a question about the relation of all value (which I shall conveniently call "the Good") to a monotheistic <B>God</B>, who will later be supposed, by Judaism, Christianity, and Isl&acirc;m, to be the Omnipotent Creator of All Things.  <img src="images/pious-2.gif" align=right>If God is the Creator of absolutely everything, then He would be the Creator of all standards of value also.  The Good would be posited by His own free, arbitrary, and omnipotent act of <B>Will</B>; and so it would be whatever he wanted it to be.  However, this makes it senseless to <I>praise</I> God as being Good or to think of Him as in any way distinguished by His goodness.  Whatever He thinks, wants, or does, it is simply good by definition, regardless of what it is.  This is, at least, disappointing.  On the other hand, if God <B>recognizes</B> what is good and <B>wants</B> to do it <B>because</B> it is good, this posits the nature of value independent of Him, so that he must, and wishes to, conform Himself to it.  This makes it sensible to praise and revere God's goodness, but it also means that God is no longer the Creator of everything:  standards of value stand above and beyond Him, outside of his control and creativity.  This is actually what Plato thought (the Forms pre&euml;xist the creative action of God, and provide the standard for it, in the <I>Timaeus</I>), and it does sound rather like Zoroastrianism, but it is, as a compromise and limitation of Omnipotence, disturbing for the monotheistic religions.  Consequently, the history of religion and philosophy shows the emphasis going indifferent ways.  Emphasis on the omnipotence and Will of God is best represented in modern philosophy by the great Jewish philosopher <B>Baruch Spinoza</B>, who does not actually believe in an arbitrary Will of God, but who certainly does <B>not</B> believe in a God who does things for a good and rational reason.  In turn, the best modern representative of God's goodness and rationality is the German philosopher <B>Gottfried Leibniz</B>, who famously believed that this was the "best of all possible worlds" because a benevolent and omnipotent God could not and would not have created a world otherwise.  <img src="images/pious-3.gif" align=right>Similarly, historical religions have gone in different directions.  As Greek philosophy, in the form of Plato and Aristotle, tended to systematize the goodness and rationality of God, the greatest systematization of the Will and Omnipotence of God may be found in <B>Isl&acirc;m</B>, where, "God does what He wishes" [<img src="images/arabic2.gif" align=middle>, <I>All&acirc;hu yaf'alu m&acirc; yash&acirc;'u</I>], <I>Qur'&acirc;n</I>, Surah 3:40 (or 3:35).  Or, as translated by Ahmed Ali [<I>Al-Qur'&acirc;n</I>, Princeton University Press, 1988, p. 215, Surah 13:31], "Have the believers not learnt that if God had so willed He could have guided all mankind?"  If this sounds harsh ("way harsh," as Alicia Silverstone says in the movie <I>Clueless</I>), something very similar may be found in the <B>Old Testament</B>, where God tells Moses, "When you go back to Egypt, see that you do before Pharaoh all the miracles which I have put in your power; but I will harden his heart, so that he will not let the people go" [Exodus, 4:21].  This is no favor to Pharaoh, nor to the Egyptians, all of whose first born are eventually killed.  While Isl&acirc;m is mostly prepared to pursue God's Omnipotence to its logical extreme, the Bible, Judaism, and Christianity are somewhat more tangled up in trying to preserve God's goodness and rationality.  Thus, even in Genesis we get:  "God saw that it was good" [Hebrew, <I>Wayyare' El&ocirc;h&icirc;m k&icirc; t&ocirc;bh</I>] (Genesis 1:10, 1:12, 1:18, 1:21, 1:25); and "And God saw everything that he had made, and behold, it was very good" (Genesis 1:31).  If whatever God does is good by definition, then it would not be necessary for God to "see" that His work was good.  Logically, however, Judaism and Christianity cannot have it both ways, unless the principle of <B>logical contradiction</B> does not apply to the Transcendent.  This possibility was considered by the Mediaeval philosopher <a href="hist-1.htm#high">William of Ockham</a>, by <a href="buddhism.htm">Buddhism</a>, and in the essay <a href="antinom.htm">"Religious Value and the Antinomies of Transcendence"</a> at the <a href="./">Friesian School</a> website.  So, obviously, this question that Socrates asks in the <I>Euthyphro</I> is significant far beyond his concerns for a definition of piety.<p>

<li>10a-10b. Euthyphro at first does not understand Socrates's question, so Socrates must explain the difference between active and passive, between the causal agent and the object affected by causality.  Thus, something "seeing" and something "being seen" are different, as something "loving" and something "being loved" are different.<p>

<li>10b-10c.  Socrates then points out the direction of the causality, that something is seen <B>because</B> something else is seeing it.  An object is not carried because it is being carried but because something carries it.  If an object could <B>cause</B> someone to carry it, this would make for a kind of nightmare reality where objects control people (like in some horror movies).<p>

<li>10c.  "...if anything comes to be, or is affected, it does not come to be because it is coming to be, but it is coming to be because it comes to be..."  This doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me.  The last two clauses seem to say the same thing.  This may be a problem with the translation, but I haven't worked out a better one yet.<p>

<li>10c.  Euthyphro agrees on the direction of causality.  This is not fatal to his argument, but Socrates does seem to think that the pious <B>must</B> have an intrinsic nature, in which case being loved by the gods, as caused by an extrinsic source, <B>could not</B> define piety.<p>

<li>10d.  "Is it loved because it is pious, or for some other reason?"  Euthyphro loses his definition by agreeing that there is "no other reason."  If the pious is loved because it is pious, then the pious must have an intrinsic nature that makes it worthy of love.  This destroys both the second and the third definitions proposed, both of which depended on the love of the gods bestowing the character of piety.  Euthyphro, of course, could have bitten the bullet and said that "it is loved" just because the gods happen to love it.  That reveals the rational opaqueness of "Spinoza's Thesis":  If the Will of God makes everything, including value, the way it is, this is ultimately for <B>no reason</B> at all except God's arbitrary and free choice.  The Greeks, and most philosophers historically, have found this ultimate irrationality intolerable, though, from a religious point of view, it is no place for mortals, like <B>Job</B>, to question the will, motives, intentions, and purposes of their Creator.<p>

<li>10d-11a.  Socrates goes over the point somewhat tediously.  The "god-beloved" and the pious are different.  If they were the same, then if the pious is loved because it is pious, the god-beloved would be loved <B>because</B> it is god-beloved, rather than god-beloved because it is loved by the gods.  Repeating this a number of ways produces a confusion similar to that at 10c above.<p>
</ul>

<li><H3><a name="eleven">Interlude (11b-11e)</a></H3>
<ul>

<li>11a-11b.  Now Socrates must ask what piety is all over again.  "...you told me an affect or quality of it...but you have not yet told me what the pious is."  Socrates maintains his ironic pose by accusing Euthyphro that, "you did not wish to make its nature clear to me."  Euthyphro, however, is completely at a loss and doesn't know what other definition to propose.  In a moment characteristic of Socratic dialogues, he is unable to imagine any new answer to Socrates's question.<p>

<li>11b-11d.  This produces a typical interlude in the dialogue.  Socrates makes a joke that, if he had been proposing definitions himself, and they kept moving around and not staying put, people could say it was because of his descent from <B>Daedalus</B>, <img src="images/greek/daedalus.gif" align=middle>, who was supposed to have been a sculptor of such lifelike statues that they would get up and run away!  It was not uncommon for Greeks to reckon their descent from characters in Greek mythology.  Usually they did not think that too many generations had passed.  That was one of the things that surprised the historian <B>Herodotus</B> when he visited Egypt, that, while the Egyptians claimed descent from gods and mythological heroes also, they counted many, many more generations back.  Indeed, the Egyptians had records of far more generations of history than the Greeks did.

<P><blockquote><a name="labyrinth">Daedalus was famous as an architect</a> as well as a sculptor and did his most impressive work for King <B>Minos</B>, <img src="images/greek/minos.gif" align=middle>, of Crete.  His greatest works were all the result of an act of impiety by Minos, who had requested a bull from Poseidon to sacrifice to him but then, when Poseidon provided the bull, decided to keep it instead.  The revenge of Poseidon took a very odd form.  He caused the Queen, <B>Pasipha&euml;</B>, <img src="images/greek/pasiphae.gif" align=middle>, to conceive an unnatural carnal desire for the bull!  Since the bull wasn't interested, she got Daedalus to build a model of a cow that would attract the bull but that she could hide in and use to have intercourse.  This worked, and Pasipha&euml; actually conceived a child by the bull.  This turned out to be a ferocious monster, with the body of a man but the head of a bull:  the <B>Minotaur</B>, <img src="images/greek/minotaur.gif" align=middle> (ironically, the "bull of Minos").  Minos then asked Daedalus to build a prison for the beast.  Daedalus built a great maze, known as the "Labyrinth," <img src="images/greek/labyrint.gif" align=middle>, <I>Lab&yacute;rinthos</I>.<img src="images/knossos.jpg" align=right>

<P>This appears to have been the real name of a real place.  In 1900 <B>Sir Arthur Evans</B> discovered a great palace at <B>Knossos</B>, <img src="images/greek/knossos.gif" align=middle>, on Crete -- so large that it would have seemed maze-like to unsophisticated visitors from the mainland.  This was part of the great pre-Greek "<B>Minoan</B>" civilization in the Aegean.  Their language, written in an undeciphered hieroglyphic form and in the syllabic Linear A, has been tentatively identified with <B>Luvian</B>, an Indo-European language spoken in Asia Minor [cf. David Abulafia, <I>The Great Sea, A Human History of the Mediterranean</I>, Oxford, 2011, p.27].  <img src="images/greek/anatolia.gif" align=right>A version of the script, Linear B, was used to write the Greek of the <B>Mycenaeans</B>, who inherited and perpetuated much of Minoan culture.  A derivative syllabary continued to be used to write Greek on <a href="archon.htm#dialects">Cyprus</a>.

<P>After it was unearthed, the civilization of Crete was soon identified with one known to the Egyptians.  Traders from <img src="images/hiero/crete01.gif" align=middle>, who appear in Egyptian tombs, wear costume that then was found in images at Knossos and other Aegaean sites.  So the identification with the Egyptian references was certain.  More intriguing is that the Egyptian word apparently also occurs in Hebrew, as <img src="images/greek/crete02.gif" align=middle>, <I>Capht&ocirc;r</I>.  <a href="notes/breast.htm"><img src="images/knossos2.jpg" align=left border=0></a>In the Book of Amos, 9:7, God says that he brought "the Philistines from Caphtor" [<I>The Interlinear NIV Hebrew-English Old Testament</I>, John R. Kohlenberger III, Zondervan Publishing House, Grand Rapids, Michigan, 1987, p.521].  If the Philistines indeed came from Crete, this confirms the growing understanding that the Philistines were in fact Mycenaean Greeks, some of whom were even accepted into Israel as the Tribe of Dan, who then get their name from the Homeric <img src="images/greek/danaoi.gif">, <I>Danao&iacute;</I>, i.e. Greeks.

<P>A great volcanic explosion on the island of <a href="notes/midking.htm#second">Thera</a>, perhaps around 1500 BC, which sent ash as far away as Egypt, damaged some of the centers of the civilization; but it is less clear why the Cretan sites, like Knossos, <img src="images/maps/thera.gif" align=right border=0>were burned and abandoned later, around 1450.

<P><a name="labrys"><I>Inthos</I> is a suffix that does not occur in Greek words proper.  It is found in pre-Greek place names -- like the name of the city of <I>Corinth</I>.

<P><img src="images/greek/labrys.gif" align=middle>, <I>L&aacute;brys</I>, is known from the non-Greek languages of Asia Minor, like <a href="greek.htm#lydia">Lydian</a>, as the word for a double-bladed axe -- just the kind of axe often pictured in the palace at Knossos, <img src="images/labrys.gif" align=left>in fact frequently as a kind of stamp or graffito on blocks in the walls -- which also tends to support the identification of the language of Linear A with those languages.  <img src="images/greek/labyrint.gif" align=middle>, <I>Labyrinthos</I> thus may simply mean "the place of the double-bladed axe."  What the palace <B>was</B> was confusedly remembered, like Troy, long after the real place was buried and lost.

<P>The actual Greek word for a couple bladed axe was <img src="images/greek/pelekys.gif" align=middle>, <I>p&eacute;lekys</I>.  This name became fatefully attached to the <a href="romania.htm#varangi">Varangian Guard</a>, which after 989 AD was the elite corps and Life Guard of the Mediaeval <a href="romania.htm#middle">Roman Emperors</a>, and who thus, armed with axes, were called the <img src="images/greek/pelekofo.gif" align=middle>, <I>pelekoph&oacute;roi</I>, the "axe bearers."  By those days, however, the <img src="images/greek/pelekys.gif" align=middle> simply meant a battle-axe, not necessarily a double-bladed one; and the images we see of the Guardsmen show them with impressive axes, with handles up to six feet long, but only single bladed -- the kind of axe previously called <img src="images/greek/hemipele.gif" align=middle>, <I>h&ecirc;mip&eacute;lekkon</I>, i.e. "half-axe" (compare <img src="images/greek/mule.gif" align=middle>, <I>h&ecirc;m&iacute;onos</I>, "mule," literally "half-ass," whose equivalent in English means something else).

<P>The destruction of Mycenaean civilization in the Aegean, the Doric invasion which reached across to Crete itself and Rhodes, the appearance of a derivative of Linear B in Cyprus, and the descent of Greeks in Palestine were all part of a vast movement of peoples at that time that erased old Empires, such as the <a href="notes/newking.htm#hittite">Hittites</a> and <a href="notes/newking.htm#mitanni">Mitanni</a>, and troubled the Egyptians with several waves of invasion by the "Sea Peoples" and then the <a href="notes/newking.htm#22">Libyans</a>.  One of the last great moments of Egyptian military might was when Ramesses III of the <a href="notes/newking.htm#20">XX Dynasty</a> (early 12th century BC) repulsed these invasions.  This era, which ushered in the Greek Dark Ages, troubled or annihilated all these old Empires, and apparently involved a vast <I>V&ouml;lkerwanderung</I> of migrating peoples, begins to look like the later, more famous, and better documented Dark Ages of the 4th and later centuries AD, when the Huns bounced across Central Asia and Germans overran the <a href="romania.htm#anthemius">Western Roman Empire</a>.  Now it is beginning to look like there was a similar natural cause for both sets of events, a <I>climatic cooling</I> of the proposed "Bond Cycle," 1,470  500 years, named after geologist Gerard Clark Bond (19402005).  The cooling that subsequently would occur in the Little Ice Age, beginning in the 14th century, which also affected <a href="sangoku.htm#ming">Ming Dynasty</a> China, however, does not seem to fit with the periodicity of this cycle.  What does, on the other hand, are the events at the end of the Old Kingdom in Egypt.  We know from Egyptian records that bad things were happening in the <a href="notes/oldking.htm#first">First Intermediate Period</a>.  The references are vague enough that they don't give us much of a picture of exactly what was going on; but from the geological record it looks like the Faiyum, a vast lake in a depression fed by the Nile, dried up, so the element of climate change is evident.  We are given no weather information for the Greek Dark Ages by ancient sources, but we are, by the historian <a href="romania.htm#climate">Procopius</a>, for the cooling of the 6th century AD.  It would be remarkable if the distruptions of the First Intermediate Period, the Greek Dark Ages, and the Mediaeval Dark Ages can all be linked by comparable forms of climate change.

<P>In the Labyrinth the Minotaur needed feeding.  Minos required that Athens send seven youths and seven maidens every year to feed it (not unlike the sacrifice to the Capitol demanded in <a href="ruling.htm#hunger"><I>The Hunger Games</I></a> books by Suzanne Collins -- although neither the books nor the 2012 movie draw any parallel with the tribute to the Minotaur).  To end this, <B>Theseus</B>, the son of the King of Athens, volunteered to go and kill the beast.  Once there, he befriended <B>Ariadne</B>, daughter of Minos.  She agreed to help him and provided a ball of thread so that, paying it out behind him, if he killed the Minotaur, he could find his way back out.  He did kill the Minotaur, and then he and Ariadne fled back to Athens.  Some versions of the story are that he abandoned her on the way (to be found by the god Dionysus), but the <I>Odyssey</I> itself says that she was slain by the goddess Artemis on the island of Dia.  In any case, on his way home Theseus forgot an agreement with his father to hoist white sails if he had survived.  When the King saw the ordinary black sails instead, he committed suicide out of grief.  Theseus thus returned to become King of Athens.  Later the Athenians kept a ship on display that they claimed was Theseus's ship.  During the Hellenistic Period it was realized that the replacement of rotting planks had, over time, resulted in every bit of wood in the ship being replaced -- so philosophers began arguing whether it was really still the same ship!

<P>What Daedalus was the most famous for, however, was what happened when Minos became angry with him for all the aforementioned goings-on and he fled from Crete with his son <B>Icarus</B>, <img src="images/greek/icarus.gif" align=middle>.  Daedalus made <I>wings</I> for the two of them, with feathers set in wax.  This worked, but then Icarus was so exhilarated with flying that he flew higher and higher.  Today we would fear hypoxemia (lack of oxygen) from this, but what happened to the mythic Icarus was that he flew too close to the sun, the wax melted in his wings, the feathers fell out, and he fell to is death.  Icarus falling from the sky is still one of the most striking images from Greek mythology.

<P><a href="philhist.htm">Philosophy of History</a></blockquote><p>

<li>11d.  After a bit more byplay about Daedalus, Socrates is ready to get back to business.<p>
</ul>

<li><H3><a name="twelve">Suggestion:  "Piety is a kind of justice." (11e-12e)</a></H3>
<ul>

<li>11e-12a.  Socrates sets out to overcome the "unncessary difficulties" that Euthyphro is making and get the dialogue started again by offering a suggestion -- a typical moment in these dialogues (we actually can see it happen <B>twice</B> in the <I>Meno</I>):  He asks whether "all that is pious is of necessity just."  Euthyphro agrees to this but then is confused when Socrates turns it around and asks if, instead, all that is just is necessarily pious.<p>

<li>12a.  "Yet you are younger than I by as much as your are wiser."  As Euthyphro gets further out of his depth, Socrates starts to tease him more than earlier.<p>

<li>12a-12c.  "...where there is fear there is also shame."  Socrates gives examples of terms whose meaning contains the meaning of others.  One is fearful of shameful things but not ashamed of all fearful things.  Similarly, odd numbers are numbers, but not all numbers are odd.<p>

<li>12c-12d.  "...for fear covers a larger area than shame."  The geographical or geometric metaphor that Socrates uses for meaning is striking and suggestive.  <img src="images/euler.gif" align=right>What is also curious is that a form of <B>illustration</B> that would be suggested by it was not implemented until the great Swiss mathematician <B>Leonhard Euler</B> (1707-1783 -- note that <I>Euler</I> in German is pronounced like "oiler" in English) began using overlapping circles to represent relations in meaning.  These became known as "Euler's Circles," although largely replaced in logic today by <a href="syllog.htm"><I>Venn Diagrams</I></a> (from the 19th century English logician, John Venn).  With Euler's Circles, we can literally show that "fear covers a larger area than shame."  We can also show that number covers a larger area than odd (number), and so, as Euthyphro agrees, justice covers a larger area than piety.<p>

<li>12d-12e.  "...we must...find out what part of the just it is."  If it is agreed that piety is part of or a kind of justice, then the question to ask is <B>what</B> part of justice it is.  Socrates wants to know how piety differs from other kinds of justice.  This is to set up the problem in the form that Aristotle would later establish as the basic form of a definition:  <B>genus and differentia</B>.  The <I>genus</I> is the <B>kind</B> of thing -- it is the Latin word for "kind," the Latin translation, of course, of Aristotle's own Greek term.  The <I>differentia</I> (Latin again) is what sets apart, what <I>differentiates</I>, specific things from others of the <B>same kind</B>.  Aristotle's own classic example of such a definition was his definition of "man" as the "rational animal."  There the genus is "animal," and the differentia is "rational."  Rationality sets men apart from other animals.  Socrates, long before Aristotle, is looking for the same form of a definition.  His suggestion that piety is a kind of justice thus sets up the question of the differentia, to give Euthyphro a chance to come up with some new ideas and get things going again.<p>

<li>12e.  "...in order to tell Meletus not to wrong us any more..."  Socrates asks the new question, about the differentia, with some fanfare, like this is now going to do the trick.<p>
</ul>

<li><H3><a name="thirteen">Fourth Definition:  "The Pious is the part of justice concerned with the care of the gods." (12e-13d)</a></H3>
<ul>

<li>12e-13a.  <img src="images/euler-2.gif" align=right>Euthyphro comes up with the differentia:  Piety is the part of justice concerned with the "care of" the gods, while the remaining part of justice concerns the "care of men."  Socrates says that Euthyphro seems to him "to put that very well," but he still needs "a bit of information."  Knowing Socrates, this requirement for "a bit of information" can be ominous indeed.<p>

<li>13a.  The difficulty is over the meaning of "care."  Socrates does not think that Euthyphro can mean care of the gods in the same way that horse breeders care for horses; but then Euthyphro surprisingly asserts that he <B>does</B> mean it that way.<p>

<li>13a-13d.  It takes a few lines to establish that Euthyphro must mean a different kind of care, since horse breeders taking care of horses, or hunters taking care of dogs, benefit horses or dogs in ways that human piety cannot possibly benefit the gods.  When Socrates asks, "Is piety then...also to benefit the gods and make them better?" Euthyphro realizes his mistake and answers no.  So Socrates must ask what kind of care of the gods piety would be.<p>
</ul>

<li><H3><a name="fourteen">Fifth Definition:  "The Pious is the part of justice concerned with the service of the gods." (13d-14a)</a></H3>
<ul>

<li>13d.  Euthyphro answers that the pious care of the gods is "the kind of care...that slaves take of their masters."  So Socrates suggests "it is likely to be a kind of service of the gods."  Euthyphro agrees.  So this modifies the previous definition, making piety into a kind of justice concerned with service to the gods.  This is getting rather close to home for Socrates; for, according to the <I>Apology</I>, his whole project of questioning people is in service to the god at Delphi, which he does regard as good and just and pious (<I>Apology</I> 35c).  So Socrates himself acts with a certain sense of piety in mind, and it does involve obedience to and service to the god -- an obedience for which he is willing to die, and does.  In those terms, Socrates cannot have any fundamental objection to Euthyphro's answer.<p>

<li>13d-13e.  Socrates does, however, ask a new question.  If piety is service to the gods, what are the gods trying to accomplish with that help?  He does not ask this immediately, but, rather out of the Blue, asks "to the achievement of what goal service to doctors tends?"  Euthyphro agrees that it is to achieving health.  We then run through the purposes of shipbuilders and housebuilders, until Socrates asks what are the similar purposes of the gods.<p>

<li>13e. "Tell me then, by Zeus, what is that excellent [<img src="images/greek/pagkalon.gif" align=middle>, <I>p&aacute;gkalon</I>, 'all beautiful'] aim [<img src="images/greek/ergon.gif" align=middle>, <I>&eacute;rgon</I>, 'work, deed'] that the gods achieve, using us as their servants?"  "You obviously know..."  Socrates teases Euthyphro for his pompous attitude again, and Euthyphro obligingly agrees again that he has "the best knowledge of the divine."  But all he can say about the "excellent aim" of the gods is that it involves <img src="images/greek/polla.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/kai.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/kalos-n.gif" align=middle>, "many fine things."<p>

<li>14a.  This is not very satisfactory for Socrates, who points out that we would have no difficulty saying that the concern of generals is victory in war and that the concern of farmers is to grow food.  So what are the "many fine things that the gods achieve?"<p>

<li>We should note this point as the <B>"high water mark"</B> of the <I>Euthyphro</I>.  This is as close as the dialogue <B>ever gets</B> to a definition of piety.  It is downhill the rest of the way.  We will have a clue, however, what kind of answer might have satisfied Socrates.  Indeed, we <B>should</B> have a clue somewhere, since we might ourselves well ask Socrates, who is in the service of the god, what he himself is supposed to be accomplishing for him.<p>
</ul>

<li><H3><a name="fifteen">Sixth Definition:  "Piety is knowledge of how to and sacrifice and pray." (14a-15b)</a></H3>
<ul>

<li>14b.  Rather longwindedly, Euthyphro now says that piety involves knowing "how to say and do what is pleasing to the gods at prayer and sacrifice."  This has benefits, while neglecting it brings misfortune.  But the definition now suddenly doesn't seem to have much to do with accomplishing the gods' purposes.  Indeed, it is entirely unresponsive to Socrates's last question.<p>

<li>14b-14c.  Socrates expresses his disappointment, both treating Euthyphro's answer as willing avoidance ("you are not keen to teach me") and as a digression from the proper approach ("you turned away").  It therefore should be noted that Socrates regarded the previous line of questioning as heading in the right direction.<p>

<li>14c-14d.  So now what is involved in prayer and sacrifice must be cleared up.  To pray is to ask from the gods and to sacrifice is to give to them.  So piety is to know about this.  Euthyphro congratulates Socrates on his understanding, which provokes an ironic jab from Socrates:  "I am so desirous of your wisdom, and I concentrate my mind on it, so that no word of yours may fall to the ground."<p>

<li>14d-14e.  Now Socrates notes that we would ask from the gods what we need, while to give correctly would be give what the gods need.  Euthyphro agrees, and Socrates then characterizes piety, consequently, as a kind of "trading skill."  Euthyphro is perhaps uncomfortable with this, since it sounds more mercenary than pious, but he agrees.<p>

<li>14e-15a.  Socrates, however, has a problem with the gods having any <B>need</B> of sacrifices from us.  So he asks what <B>benefit</B> the gods would have from our gifts to them.  At the same time he stipulates, "What they give us is obvious to all.  There is for us no good that we do not receive from them."  This is a telling passage for Socrates's views about the gods.  And, if there is "no good" that we do not get from the gods, is this not the answer to the question about the gods' purposes?  Are not the gods, indeed, always trying to accomplish simply <B>the good</B>?  That could well complete the definition of piety that Socrates was looking for.  At the same time, such a definition would simply open the further question:  What is the good?  If the business of the gods is to accomplish the good, then we would have to worry about what that is.<p>

<li>15a-15b.  Euthyphro is not going to admit, as Socrates would not, that the gods are actually benefited by our sacrifices.  Our gifts are not actually <B>needed</B> by them.  So why bother?  Euthyphro suggests that the gifts are made out of reverence and gratitude.  Since this would not benefit the gods, what is it to them?  It is, Euthyphro says, <B>dear</B> to them.<p>
</ul>

<li><H3><a name="sixteen">Seventh Definition:  "Piety is what is dear to the gods." (15b-15c)</a></H3>
<ul>

<li>15b-15c.  But if the pious is simply what is dear to the gods, this brings us back to one of the original definitions, the second one.  So Socrates tells Euthyphro that he is much more skillful than Daedalus, making the arguments not just move around but having them "go round in a circle."  He points out that it was already agreed that the pious could not be the "god-beloved," but now what is "dear to the gods" is precisely that.  So they have come back to an agreed upon mistake and must set out again.<p>
</ul>
</ul>

<li><H2><a name="seventeen">Conclusion (15c-16a)</a></H2>
<ul>

<li>15c-15d.  "So we must investigate again from the beginning...."  Probably the most terrifying words to hear from Socrates.  Of course, this will not happen.  Euthyphro is going to flee.  The allusion to Proteus is apt:  Proteus could answer all questions, but he didn't want to, and would assume any form to scare away the questioner.  The way to handle him, however, was just to grab hold and hold on, regardless of any form he might assume.  Eventually Proteus would give up and answer questions [<I>Odyssey</I> IV:365-422].  Euthyphro, who knows that he cannot answer the questions, does not want to continue the torture of the eternal grasp of Socrates!<p>

<li>15c-15d.  Socrates remains in ironic character, humbly petitioning Euthyphro ("do not think me unworthy") to continue his instruction.  But we now see the point:  "If you had no clear knowledge of piety and impiety, you would never have ventured to prosecute your old father for murder..."  Since it is now obvious that Euthyphro <B>does not</B> have "clear knowledge of piety and impiety," it should be obvious to anyone, even Euthyphro, that he indeed <B>should never</B> have prosecuted his father.  Socrates remains in character as Euthyphro's student, but he is here clearly laying out the conclusions that Euthyphro should draw.  All Euthyphro needs to do is admit his own ignorance and then connect the dots.  But Socrates <B>will not</B> simply tell him what to do.<p>

<li>15d-15e.  "For fear of the gods..."  That is, Euthyphro <B>should</B> fear the gods for what he is doing.  "...and would have been ashamed before men..."  That is, Euthyphro <B>should be</B> ashamed before men.  "...but now I know well..."...unless Euthyphro has knowledge of piety and impiety, so either get on with it, or admit his ignorance.<p>

<li>15e-16a.  Euthyphro will not admit his ignorance, so he can only flee.  But Socrates still remains in his ironic pose.  He is cast down from a great hope; he will not escape Meletus's indictment; and he will not be able to avoid being careless and inventive about divine matters.  Of course, this is Socrates's way of pointing out, again, that <I>Euthyphro</I> has been careless and inventive about divine matters.  Instead of Socrates losing the chance to be "better for the rest of my life," it is Euthyphro who has lost that chance by failing to grasp the lesson of the dialogue.  But Socrates will not simply <B>tell</B> him anything.  Euthyphro had to make the essential step himself, which he would not do.

<P>Kronos was later regarded as the god of Time because of a pun on his name, which resembles the Greek word for "time," <img src="images/greek/khronos.gif" align=middle>, <I>khr&oacute;nos</I>.  We still see Kronos as "Father Time" every New Year's, usually with a baby to represent the new year, and also usually still equipped with his scythe!  Perhaps this should remind us of <a href="gita.htm#trinity">Bhagavad Gita</a> 11:32, <img src="images/greek/bedeath.gif" align=middle>, "I am all-powerful Time which destroys all things."  The scythe may not just be for genitals.
