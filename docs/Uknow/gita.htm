<H3 align=center>using the Juan Mascar&oacute; translation (Penguin Books, 1962), with references to the Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan and Charles A. Moore translation (<I>A Sourcebook in Indian Philosophy</I>, Princeton, 1957)</H3>

<P>The <I>Bhagavad G&icirc;ta</I>, <img src="images/greek/gita.gif" align=middle>, is a chapter in the Epic, the <img src="images/greek/sanskrtc.gif" align=middle>, <a href="#bharat"><I>Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata</I></a>.  A <I>g&icirc;ta</I>, <img src="images/greek/gita2.gif" align=middle>, alone is a "song or poem," and there is actually more than one <I>g&icirc;ta</I> just in the <I>Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata</I>.  However, anyone talking about "<B>The G&icirc;ta</B>" will almost certainly be taken to refer to the <I>Bhagavad G&icirc;ta</I>. <I>Bhagavad</I> is an interesting word.  <I>Bhaga</I>, <img src="images/greek/gita3.gif" align=middle>, alone means "lord" or "good fortune, grandure, loveliness," etc.  This is a cognate of <I>bog</I>, <img src="images/greek/bog.gif" align=middle>, which is "God" in Russian, but also of <I>phagein</I>, <img src="images/greek/phagein.gif" align=middle>, "to eat" in Greek.  So the Indo-European meanings have drifted around a bit [cf. <I>The American Heritage Dictionary of Indo-European Roots</I>, Second Edition, revised and edited by Calvert Watkins, Houghton Mifflin Company, 2000, p.7].  In turn, <I>bhagavat</I>, <img src="images/greek/gita4.gif" align=middle>, is "fortunate, blessed, adorable, venerable, divine, holy," etc. [<I>A Practical Sanskrit Dictionary</I> by Arthur Anthony MacDonell, Oxford, 1929, 1971, p.200].  So the <I>Bhagavad G&icirc;ta</I>, <img src="images/greek/gita.gif" align=middle>, is the "Song of God," or of the "Adorable One," "Blessed One," "Holy One," etc.  The "Adorable One," of course, is <B>Krishna</B>, <img src="images/greek/krishna.gif" align=middle>, who is an Incarnation of <a href="gods.htm">Vi&#x015b;nu</a>, <img src="images/greek/vishnu.gif" align=middle>.

<P>This page consists of "comments" on the <I>Bhagavad G&icirc;ta</I>, rather than a "commentary," because not every verse is disucussed.  Also, the point of view here is not devotionalistic but historical and philosophical.  The G&icirc;ta is a composite document, built over time, like the larger <I>Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata</I>.  Different parts of the G&icirc;ta reflect different and sometimes conflicting influences and values.  The question that Arjuna asks at the beginning of Chapter 3, which asserts that Krishna has contradicted himself in Chapter 2, reflects no contradiction in Chapter 2, which was perfectly consistent, but does signal the conflict between action and renunciation that will emerge in Krishna's <I>answer</I> to Arjuna.  This is a key issue in all of Indian religion, where the renunciation of the world is the ultimate value in <a href="karma.htm">Jainism</a> and <a href="buddhism.htm">Buddhism</a>, and is deeply engrained in Hinduism.  But it is opposed or limited by the doctrine of <B>karmayoga</B>, <img src="images/greek/yoga-2.gif" align=middle>, in the <I>Bhagavad G&icirc;ta</I>, where the conflict is evident in the text.  Devotionalistic commentary on the G&icirc;ta may be found through the link to the Online <I>Bhagavad G&icirc;ta</I> at the bottom of the page.

<P><ul>
<li><H2>Chapter 1</H2>
<ul>
<li>1.  Dh&#x1e5b;tar&acirc;&#x1e63;&#x1e6d;ra, the blind King who cannot be present at the battle, asks his attendant Sanjaya what is going on.<p>

<li><img src="images/krishna.jpg" align=right width=450>2-23.  Sanjaya, who has been given clairvoyant powers, by the Sage <img src="images/greek/vyasa.gif" align=middle>, to see the battle for the King, describes the scene of the battlefield, ultimately (20) coming to Krishna and Arjuna in their chariot.  Arjuna asks Krishna to drive the chariot out between the armies and surveys the scene.<p>

<li>28-47.  The "Lament of Arjuna."  Arjuna realizes that he doesn't want to fight the battle and kill his relatives and friends, who are often fighting in the army of the Kurus just out of loyalty to the King, not because they believe in the justice of the Kuru's cause.<p>

<li>32.  Krishna is called <img src="images/greek/govinda.gif" align=middle>, "Govinda," from the Sanskrit word for "cow," <img src="images/greek/go.gif" align=middle>, <I>go</I> (Vedic <I>gau</I>, Persian <img src="images/greek/gav.gif" align=middle>, <I>g&acirc;v</I>, English "cow").  This refers to Krishna's youth, when he played with the <I>gopis</I> (<img src="images/greek/gopi.gif" align=middle>), the "cowherdesses" or "milkmaids," who included Radha, Krishna's lover, shown on the cover of the Penguin edition of the <I>Gita</I>, even though she isn't in the <I>Gita</I>.<p>

<li>35.  "The three worlds."  The heavens, the air, and the earth are the "three worlds."<p>

<li>40.  "Rituals of righteousness."  These are the household rituals of the Vedic religion, whose fundamental unit was, like Greek and Roman religion, the home.<p>

<li>41.  "The women sin."  Illegitimate children would create "disorder of castes, social confusion."  An ironic fear, since Arjuna and his brothers actually are not the children of their father Pa&#x1e47;&#x1e0d;u.  The last legitimate Bh&acirc;rata was really Bh&icirc;&#x1e63;ma.  The "social confusion" has already occurred.<p>

<li><a name="debt">42.  "The spirits of their dead suffer in pain when deprived of the ritual offerings."  This is about the <I>pit&#x1e5b;yaj&ntilde;a</I>, <img src="images/greek/pitroff.gif" align=middle>, the <a href="caste.htm#debt">offerings</a> of food and water to the ancestors.  How can the dead suffer when they simply get reincarnated and endure the fruits of their <I>karma</I>, good or bad?  This statement comes from the older level of Vedic belief.  As with the Greeks, the dead were originally thought to descend into the Underworld, where they were miserable, especially without offerings from their descendants.<p>

<li>46.  "Better for me if the sons of Dhrita-rashtra...found me unarmed, unresisting, and killed me in the struggle of war."  This was actually Mah&acirc;tma Gandhi's advice, and the <I>Gita</I> was Gandhi's favorite text.  So we might think this will be the lesson of the <I>Gita</I>.  But the lesson will actually be that Arjuna must fight the battle.  To Gandhi, this simply meant that one must do one's <I>dharma</I>.
</ul><p>

<li><H2>Chapter 2</H2>
<ul>
<li>1-3.  Krishna has no sympathy with Arjuna's difficulty.  "Be a man," is essentially what he says.<p>

<li>4-9.  Arjuna continues his Lament.<p>

<li><a name="teacher">4-5.</a>  "My sacred teachers."  Drona, <img src="images/greek/drona.gif" align=middle>, is Arjuna's teacher.  Killing him is shocking to Arjuna for the same kind of reason that Euthyphro prosecuting his father was shocking to Socrates:  the teacher (<img src="images/greek/guru.gif" align=middle>, <I>guru</I>) has a sacred office.  The saying in India is, "The teacher is God," because the teacher stands in the place of God to teach religious duties.  (Indian ideas about marriage may be inferred from the principle that a woman's husband is her "sacred teacher":  &nbsp;The teacher is God; her husband is a woman's teacher; therefore....)<p>

<li>11-25.  Krishna eloquently answers Arjuna.  His first argument is that Arjuna should "cease from sorrow" (25) because he cannot actually kill his relatives.  The Spirit in them is immortal and will simply pass on to a new body.<p>

<li><a name="unreal">16.  <img src="images/greek/sanskrt9.gif" align=middle>, <I>N&acirc;sato vidy&aacute;te bh&acirc;vo, n&acirc;bh&acirc;vo vidy&aacute;te satah</I>.  "The unreal never is; the Real never is not" is the translation of Juan Mascar&oacute;.  We also find, "There is no becoming of what did not already exist, there is no unbecoming of what does exist," from J.A.B. van Buitenen [<I>The Bhagavadg&icirc;t&acirc; in the Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata</I>, University of Chicago Press, 1981, pp.74-75], and "Nothing of nonbeing comes to be, nor does being cease to exist," from Barbara Stoler Miller [<I>The Bhagavad Gita, Krishna's Counsel in Time of War</I>, Bantam Books, 1986, p.49].  This sounds like <a href="greek.htm#hamlet">Parmenides</a>:  Not-Being cannot be; Being cannot not be.  The structure of this statement in Sanskrit perplexed me for many years, until it was pointed out to me that both clauses begin with contractions.  Thus, <I>n&acirc;sato</I> and <I>n&acirc;bh&acirc;vo</I> are short for <I>na-asato</I> and <I>na-abh&acirc;vo</I>.  We have both a negative and what in Greek would be called an "alpha privative," which provides a second negative.  Juan Mascar&oacute;'s translation is the closest to the Sanskrit wording, but there is no word for "never" in Sanskrit.  <I>Vidy&aacute;te</I> functions as a copula, "be found, exist."  <I>Asato</I> and <I>abh&acirc;vo</I> can both mean "non-existence," but <I>bh&acirc;va</I> also has the sense of "becoming, arising," from the root <img src="images/greek/bhu.gif" align=middle>, <I>bh&ucirc;</I>, which is cognate to "be" in English, <I>fieri</I>, "to become," in Latin, and <I>phyein</I>, "to grow," in Greek -- whence <img src="images/greek/physis.gif" align=middle>, <I>physis</I>, "nature," <img src="images/greek/physika.gif" align=middle>, <I>physika</I>, "physics."  The most literal translation might be, "Non-existence does not come to be; what does not come to be is not."  [See <a href="nothing.htm">The Metaphysics of Nothing</a>.]<p>

<li>26-30.  Krishna's second argument is that, even if Arjuna can't get past the killing part, the truth is that death is simply followed by rebirth, so it amounts to the same thing as the first argument.  Again, "cease thou to sorrow" (30).<p>

<li>31-33.  Krishna's third argument provides a positive reason, the only one, why Arjuna must fight the battle:  It is his <img src="images/greek/dharma.gif" align=middle>, <I>dharma</I>, his duty, as a <img src="images/greek/varna-2.gif" align=middle>, <I>K&#x1e63;atriya</I> to fight the battle.  This is the problem with Gandhi's desire to interpret the <I>Gita</I> pacifistically:  <I>K&#x1e63;atriyas</I> really were in the business of fighting, and both Krishna and Arjuna are <I>Kshatriyas</I>.  Krishna's argument is appropriately directed in the context.<p>

<li>34-36.  Krishna's fourth and final argument adds an emotional goad to his substantive arguments:  If Arjuna doesn't fight, people will think he is a coward and will insult him.  We can't have that!  Indeed, more fights probably result from insults against manhood than from anybody's sense of duty.  Krishna is willing to use both against Arjuna.<p>

<li>37-38.  Krishna wraps up his appeal.  Victory or loss don't matter.  Loss will simply gain him "glory in heaven."  All that matters is that Arjuna fight the battle.<p>

<li>39.  An important verse, where the Penguin translation has happily left "Sankhya" and "Yoga" untranslated.  One interpretation of the verse is that Sankhya (<img src="images/greek/school06.gif" align=middle>) represents <I>theory</I> and Yoga (<img src="images/greek/school07.gif" align=middle>) <I>practice</I>.  "Sankhya" could mean "counting," "reckoning," "reasoning," or "knowledge."  Krishna has thus given Arjuna the requisite knowledge, next he will teach the practical application of the knowledge, the Yoga that is the means to salvation.  But another interpretation of the verse depends on recognizing that "Sankhya" and "Yoga" are also the <I>proper names</I> of Schools of philosophy, the earliest schools independent of the Vedas, contemporaneous with the Upanishads themselves (see <a href="six.htm">The "Six Schools" of Indian Philosophy</a>).  Verse 39 thus may be telling us that the <I>Gita</I> contains the teachings of the Sankhya and Yoga Schools, as indeed it does in Chapter 2 and elsewhere.  One theory is that the <I>Gita</I> was originally a popularized presentation of the Sankhya and Yoga Schools.  (Be that as it may, most of the <I>Gita</I> consists of later additions, which are extremely devotionalistic, while Sankhya and Yoga had originally been atheistic.)  The <I>Gita</I> thus may be said to be both a <I>product</I> and a <I>source</I> of Indian philosophy -- the product of the Sankhya and Yoga Schools, but then a source as one of the authoritative texts, along with the Upanishads and others, of later Ved&acirc;nta.<p>

<li>42-44.  An attack on what we could call "Vedic fundamentalism."  Those who do their Vedic duties hoping for reward, do get good <I>karma</I>, but they also get reborn.  This both foolish and selfish to Krishna.<p>

<li>45.  "The three Gu&#x1e47;as of Nature."  The theory of the gu&#x1e47;as, <img src="images/greek/guna.gif" align=middle> (see <a href="elements.htm#india">The Indian & Buddhist Elements, and the Gu&#x1e47;as</a>), is characteristic of the Sankhya school, though later it is adopted by nearly everyone in the tradition.  Salvation means becoming free of the <I>gu&#x1e47;as</I>.<p>

<li><a name="text-1">47.  <img src="images/greek/imperatj.gif" align=middle>, <I>Karma&#x1e47;y ev&acirc;dhik&acirc;ras te m&acirc; phale&#x1e63;u kad&acirc;cana/</I>, <img src="images/greek/imperatk.gif" align=middle>, <I>m&acirc; karmaphalahetur bh&ucirc;r m&acirc; te sango 'stv akarma&#x1e47;i</I>, "<B>Set thy heart upon thy work, but never on its reward.  Work not for a reward; but never cease to do thy work</B>" [<a href="#note-1">note</a>].  This is the actual <I>principle</I> of the Yoga:  &nbsp;to do one's <I>dharma</I>, but desire no reward for doing good.  This is the kind of mental detachment that enables one to avoid <I>karma</I> even while continuing to physically act.  Cross-culturally, this is an all but universal principle of the worth of moral intentions:  &nbsp;from <a href="confuci.htm">Confucius</a> to <a href="kant.htm">Immanuel Kant</a>, the proper motive of moral action is to do what is right simply because it is right.  To do what is right out of hope for reward or for good consequences, even though that is the argument of philosophers like Plato and John Stuart Mill, simply reduces morality to a form of calculating prudence.  In Catholic theology, doing good out of the hope of heaven and fear of hell will indeed get one into heaven, but nowhere near as close to God as from doing good for its own sake.  God evidently has less respect for those who merely seem to be calculating the best return.<p>

<li>50.  "Goes beyond what is well done and what is not well done."  Whether one does something well or not doesn't matter.  All that counts is the effort to do one's <I>dharma</I>.  Success is irrelevant.<p>

<li>57.  "Who neither rejoices nor sorrows if fortune is good or is ill."  The mental attitude of the Yoga is indifferent to consequences as well as to rewards.  All that counts, again, is that one does one's <I>dharma</I>.<p>

<li>58.  "Even as a tortoise withdraws all its limbs."  A striking image, but as the tortoise withdraws its head and limbs, Arjuna is <I><B>not</B></I> being asked to physically withdraw from the battle.  He is <I>mentally</I> supposed to withdraw, so as to become detached from his own actions.<p>

<li>59.  "Pleasures of sense, but not desires, disappear from the austere soul."  The "austere soul" refers to ascetics who withdraw from the world.  Krishna disapproves of them because they avoid their <I>dharma</I>.  His critique is that their withdrawal will not help if <I>mentally</I> they are still attached, still have desires.  They will still acquire <I>karma</I>, despite their asceticism.  But if mental detachment can avoid <I>karma</I>, then there is no good reason not to do one's <I>dharma</I> and continue to participate in the world.  This is the aspect of the <I>Gita</I> that strongly appealed to Mah&acirc;tma Gandhi, who was engaged in political action that traditionally would have been thought futile.<p>

<li>72.  "The Nirvana of Brahman."  Here Brahman is mentioned, though in the <I>Gita</I> Brahman is thought of as a personal God, and identical to Krishna.  But "Nirv&acirc;&#x1e47;a" is more a Buddhist than a Hindu term.  It literally means "blown [v&acirc;-a&#x1e47;a] out [nis]," and so "extinction."  This is appropriate for Buddhism, where there is no Self and salvation is to be free of such a delusion.  But the Self is not "blown out" in Hinduism.  Brahman is indestructible.  The use of "Nirvana" here may reveal Buddhist influence.  Even though Hinduism was always very hostile to Buddhism, it was strongly affected by Buddhist influence for many centuries.
</ul><p>

<li><H2>Chapter 3</H2>
<ul>
<li>1-2.  Arjuna asks a strange question.  Krishna never said that "vision is greater than action" in Chapter 2, and there were no "contradictions" in his presentation.  So what is happening here?<p>

<li>3.  Krishna introduces the contradictions in his answer.  Now, suddenly, Sankhya has become a separate Yoga, <I><B>j&ntilde;&acirc;nayoga</B></I> (<img src="images/greek/yoga-1.gif" align=middle>), and the Yoga of Chapter 2 becomes <I><B>karmayoga</B></I> (<img src="images/greek/yoga-2.gif" align=middle>).  In terms of the <I>Gita</I>, there is no reason why that should happen, and it confuses things from now on.  What this change represents, however, is a real tension in the Indian tradition.  While the idea of karmayoga is to participate in life, do one's <I>dharma</I>, and achieve salvation at the same time, there is a powerful sense in the Indian tradition that salvation can be achieved only by renouncing the world and becoming a hermit or wandering ascetic.  J&ntilde;&acirc;nayoga represents that sentiment.  Besides the argument whether it is <I>possible</I> to achieve salvation through karmayoga, the problem then becomes whether it is even necessary to do one's <I>dharma</I> first.  Buddhism and Jainism forcefully endorse the idea that renunciation should be pursued as soon as one wishes.  The Buddha himself, after all, left his wife after she had just given birth to their first child.  This involved a serious violation of his <I>dharma</I> as a Householder (see the theory of the "four stages of life" in the essay about the <a href="caste.htm">Caste System</a>), and was embarrassing to Buddhism when it was preached in China -- where Confucians had no use for a man who abandoned his family.  <img src="images/yoga.gif" align=right>Hinduism has tried to hold the line, not always successfully, against dispensing with one's <I>dharma</I>, but the sense now, indeed, is that salvation cannot be achieved through action.  Thus, if karmayoga is not really a means to salvation, it is not really a yoga; and it actually can be found called merely the <I>karmamarga</I>, the "way" of action, without the promise of salvation.  That cannot happen, of course, in the <I>Gita</I>, where the whole point of the argument is karmayoga, the Yoga of Chapter 2, as the means of salvation.<p>

<li>4-8.  Having admitted there is another yoga, Krishna immediately must disparage it and explain why Arjuna must practice karmayoga.  One argument is that "not even for a moment can a man be without action" (5), so karmayoga must be practiced to deal with that anyway.  Another point is that "he who withdraws himself from actions, but ponders on their pleasures in his heart" (6), in other words, the "austere soul" we heard about earlier, will not avoid karma.  But finally, Krishna must simply claim, "Action is greater than inaction" (8).<p>

<li>16.  "Thus was the Wheel of the Law set in motion."  Another sign of Buddhist influence, since the "Wheel of the Law" (<a href="buddhism.htm#dharma"><I>Dharmacakra</I></a>) is a profoundly Buddhist symbol:  the Buddha set the Wheel in motion when he began to preach the <I>Dharma</I>, but, like a real wheel, the <I>Dharma</I> slows down and is expected to stop eventually, when it will be time for the Future Buddha (Maitreya) to appear.  The Buddha himself said the <I>Dharma</I> would only last 500 years.  After that time had passed, Buddhism found itself in a somewhat embarrassing position.  By the Middle Ages, a theory was elaborated in China and Japan that the "True <I>Dharma</I>" age had indeed only lasted 500 years, but after that would come a "Counterfeit <I>Dharma</I>" age of 1000 years, and then a "Final <I>Dharma</I>" age of 10,000 years.  The difference between them was supposed to be that in the "True <I>Dharma</I>" age, Buddhism would be preached and practiced and would deliver salvation, while in the "Counterfeit <I>Dharma</I>" age Buddhism would be preached and practiced, but would not deliver salvation, while in the "Final <I>Dharma</I>" Buddhism would merely be preached.  This was also somewhat embarrassing, and various sects arose (e.g. J&ocirc;d&ocirc; and Nichiren in Japan) on the principle that salvation could be achieved even under the "Final <I>Dharma</I>."  None of this had anything to do with the <I>Bhagavad Gita</I>.<p>

<li>27.  "But the man lost in selfish delusion thinks that he himself is the actor."  An important doctrine of the Sankhya School is that the true Self (the <I>&Acirc;tman</I> or <I>Puru&#x1e63;a</I>) does not cause anything to happen in the world.  The gu&#x1e47;as are the causes of all events.  Salvation, therefore, is to overcome the "delusion" that we have any effect on events, or that they can really affect us.  Life is just like watching a movie:  we can get caught up in it emotionally, but it really can't materially affect us.
</ul><p>

<li><a name="sun"><H2>Chapter 4</H2>
<ul>
<li>1.  Krishna reveals that he has taught his Yoga to the Sun, who passed it on.<p>

<li>4.  Arjuna objects that Krishna isn't that old.<p>

<li>5-8.  Krishna now reveals that he is an Incarnation of Eternal God (traditionally taken to be Vi&#x1e63;&#x1e47;u), who causes Himself to be born as needed to help humanity and righteousness.<p>

<li>9.  "He who knows my birth as God....goes no more from death to death..."  The promise of <B><I>bhaktiyoga</I></B>  (<img src="images/greek/yoga-3.gif" align=middle>) -- faith in Krishna is a means to salvation.  This is never <I>called</I> "bhaktiyoga" in the Gita, and the implication is always that Krishna wants everyone to be devoted to him, even if they are practicing another yoga.  The traditional interpretation of the <I>Gita</I> in Ved&acirc;nta that bhaktiyoga may only be for those personalities dominated by the gu&#x1e47;a <I>tamas</I> (i.e. Vai&#x015b;yas, &#x015a;udras, Untouchables, and perhaps women too) really diverges from the sense of the <I>Gita</I> itself.  Krishna never has anything good to say about <I>tamas</I>, or anything bad to say about bhaktiyoga.  Contempt for devotionalism only occurs on the philosophical side of Hinduism.<p>

<li>18.  "Who in his work finds silence, and who sees that silence is work."  Another translation has for this, "He who in action sees inaction and action in inaction" (Radhakrishnan & Moore).  That brings out the paradox better.  How can inaction be action?  It depends on what's doing it.  It is the body that is acting, but with an attitude of mental detachment, the mind is not acting.<p>

<li>20-22.  Elaborates the implications of the <I>mental attitude</I> that goes with karmayoga.  The yogi "expects nothing," "relies on nothing" (20), "only his body works" (21, as inferred in verse 18), "in success or in failure he is one," etc.  This makes karmayoga very difficult.  One must do one's   <I>dharma</I>, whether it means killing relatives as Arjuna must, or merely having sexual relations with one's spouse to have children and fulfill the duty to one's ancestors.  But that doesn't sound like the makings of a good marriage:  to be the same in "success or in failure," in "pleasure or pain" (2:38), while "only his body works," sounds like a very cold and distant way to make babies.  Since <I>pleasure</I> (<I>k&acirc;ma</I>) is otherwise regarded as one of the four "<a href="caste.htm#aims">aims of life</a>" (<I>dharma</I>, wealth, pleasure, & salvation), it was hard for Hinduism in the long run to get very enthusiastic about karmayoga in this sense.  This was one of the major reasons, I think, why karmayoga ceased to be very popular; but it may also have been another reason why it <I>was</I> popular with Mah&acirc;tma Gandhi, who was guilty about sexual desire and eventually determined to practice celibacy in his own marriage.  In the four stages of life, Hinduism never required celibacy while still in marriage.
</ul><p>

<li><H2>Chapter 5</H2>
<ul>
<li>1.  Arjuna asks essentially the same questions that he did at the beginning of Chapter 3.<p>

<li>2-5.  Krishna must repeat many of the same disparagements of renunciation.  "True" renunciation is the mental attitude, "craves not nor hates," rather than avoiding "holy work."  The "end of the two" are indeed the same, but the "paths" really <I>are</I> different if one avoids <I>dharma</I> through renunciation and the other doesn't.<p>

<li>6.  "But renunciation...is difficult to attain without Yoga of work."  I do not think this is true.  An attitude of mental detachment is much easier if the person is removed from demanding situations.  Killing people or having sexual relations as part of one's <I>dharma</I> makes it very difficult to have "evenness of mind."  An important reason, again, why karmayoga has not been very popular.<p>

<li>7.  "I am not doing any work....he remembers:  'It is the servants of my soul that are working.'"  Again, as at 3:27, this passage, quite eloquently, expresses the Sankhya doctrine that the true Self neither affects nor is affected by anything in the world.  The "servants of my soul" are the <I>gu&#x1e47;as</I>, which constitute and cause everything that happens.  Salvation is to see through the delusion and be free of the <I>gu&#x1e47;as</I>.
</ul><p>

<li><H2>Chapter 6</H2>
<ul>
<li>1.  "Sanyasi."  A "<I>sanny&acirc;sin</I>," or Wandering Ascetic, who actually has entirely left ordinarily life and is dead to his family, is here defined in terms of karmayoga as merely one who <I>mentally</I> has become detached from action.  A real "<I>sanny&acirc;sin</I>" actually <I><B>does</B></I> "light not the sacred fire or offers not the holy sacrifice" because he is formally beyond <I>dharma</I> and the requirements of ordinary life.<p>

<li>8.  "To him gold or stones or earth are one."  A striking test for the Yogi:  Viewing a pile of gold (at $390 an ounce) with the same emotion as a pile of stones or earth will really show the nature of one's mental detachment.<p>

<li>10-14.  An extraordinary passage.  Usually, when Krishna mentions renunciation (j&ntilde;&acirc;nayoga), it is to contrast it unfavorably with karmayoga or to clarify that "true" renunciation is the mental attitude of detachment, not the abandonment of <I>dharma</I>.  Here, however, we have an entire passage describing a completely renunciatory practice:  meditation, or <B><I>dhy&acirc;nayoga</I></B> (<img src="images/greek/yoga-4.gif" align=middle>).  What Krishna says certainly sounds strange enough:  To go to a "secret place," "in deep solitude," with "a seat that is restful," does not sound like the typical advice on the battlefield.  As Arjuna, one might be tempted to shout, "Yes! Let's go there now!"  There is also the strange reference to the "vow of holiness" (14).  Radhakrishnan and Moore translate it as "the vow of celibacy," which is consistent with practicing meditation as a <I>sanny&acirc;sin</I> but is <I><B>not</B></I> consistent with Arjuna's status as a <I>Kshatriya</I> householder with two wives.  Arjuna has not taken any "vow of celibacy" -- it would be inconsistent with his <I>dharma</I>.  This passage helps demonstrate the composite nature of the <I>Gita</I>.  It really doesn't belong in the context.
</ul><p>

<li><H2>Chapter 8</H2>
<ul>
<li>1-3.  Arjuna asks about Brahman, Atman, and Karma.  Krishna does not give a very good answer, but it is noteworthy that these ideas come up and are addressed in some manner.<p>

<li>5.  "He in truth comes unto me."  A repetition of the basic promise of bhaktiyoga.  Krishna speaks as a Savior.
</ul><p>

<li><H2>Chapter 9</H2>
<ul>
<li>18.  "I am the Way."  Krishna again speaking as Savior.  Sounds like Jesus at John 14:6, "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the
 life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.
"<p>

<li>32.  "However weak or humble or sinful they may be -- women or Vaisyas or Sudras."  This condescending and patronizing passage, with the implication that women, Vai&#x015b;yas, and &#x015a;udras are weak, humble, and sinful, nevertheless represents an opening up of Hinduism:  from the exclusion of &#x015a;udras from the Vedic religion (they could be put to death for speaking Sanskrit), to the provision in Jainism that only <I><B>men</B></I> who were naked monks could achieve salvation, Krishna now says that <I><B>everyone</B></I> can achieve salvation through bhaktiyoga.  Note that Untouchables don't come in for mention.<p>

<li>33.  "How much more the holy Brahmins and the royal saints [Kshatriyas]...."  A good indication that Krishna regards bhaktiyoga as something that <I>everyone</I> should practice, even if they have enough on the ball to practice J&ntilde;&acirc;nayoga or karmayoga.  The later Ved&acirc;nta interpretation is that the yogas suit the respective personalities determined by the gu&#x1e47;as, where bhaktiyoga would only be for those dull and stupid and lazy enough to be unable to practice j&ntilde;&acirc;nayoga or karmayoga.
</ul><p>

<li><H2>Chapter 10</H2>
<ul>
<li>12.  "Supreme Brahman, Light supreme...."  Krishna is now far more than Arjuna's friend.  The language inflates considerably.<p>

<li>19.  "Some manifestations of my divine glory....there is no end to my infinite greatness."  Krishna now reveals his divine manifestations.<p>

<li>21.  "I am Vishnu."  Although Krishna himself was born and will die, and Vi&#x1e63;&#x1e47;u is eternal, unborn, and undying, Krishna manages to make it sound like Vi&#x1e63;&#x1e47;u is the minor aspect.<p>

<li>23.  "Among the terrible powers I am the god of destruction."  Radhakrishnan and Moore translate, "of the Rudras I am &#x015a;amkara (&#x015a;iva)."  "Rudra" itself is an alternate name for &#x015a;iva.  Thus Krishna claims to be &#x015a;iva, since there can only be a single One God.
</ul><p>

<li><a name="reveal"><H2>Chapter 11</H2>
<ul>
<li>5.  "By hundreds and then by thousands..."  Krishna shows Arjuna, through most of the chapter, a visual manifestation of all his incarnations and manifestations.<p>

<li>8.  "Divine sight."  In the middle of the battlefield, only Arjuna will see Krishna's manifestations.<p>

<li><a name="trinity">32-34.</a>  <img src="images/oppen.jpg" align="right">A chilling and historically significant passage.  Verse 32 was remembered by Robert Oppenheimer, who was in charge of the Manhattan Project (which built the first atomic bombs), when he saw the very first bomb explode at <a href="ross/trinity.htm">Trinity Site</a> in New Mexico (nearer Socorro than Alamogordo, where the wire service story was filed), on July 16, 1945.  Oppenheimer was familiar with a different translation:  

<P><center><img src="images/greek/bedeath.gif"></center>

<P>"Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds."  This seems more to the point, for the Atomic Bomb, than "I am all-powerful Time which destroys all things."  The word <img src="images/greek/death.gif" align=middle>, <I>k&acirc;la</I>, can mean "Time, fate; death, god of death," so both translations express part of the meaning.<p>

<li>33.  "Through the fate of their Karma I have doomed them to die."  "Karma" here could mean either "action" or the "apurva" which causes just desserts.<p>
</ul>

<li><H2>Chapter 12</H2>
<ul>
<li>1.  Arjuna asks another one of his embarrassing questions.  This time it is about the relationship of Brahman to Krishna.  Do the "best Yogis" seek union with Brahman, or depend on Krishna?<p>

<li>2-4.  Krishna must admit that those focused on Brahman will achieve salvation, but he likes those who love <I>him</I> better -- and he likes the thought that the goal of salvation is union with himself.  Those <I>actually</I> focused on Brahman would not agree.  This is the difference between (unqualified) Advaita Ved&acirc;nta and Dvaita Ved&acirc;nta:  for Dvaita Ved&acirc;nta, Krishna actually <I><B>is</B></I> Brahman, while the Advaita Ved&acirc;nta we have been considering does not take Brahman to be a personal God.  Instead Brahman is the &Acirc;tman, our own Self.<p>

<li>5.  "Greater is the toil."  Indeed, J&ntilde;&acirc;nayoga focused on Brahman is more difficult than bhaktiyoga, but then karmayoga is the most difficult of all.<p>

<li>17.  "Beyond good and evil."  This was the title of a book by <a href="nietzsch.htm">Friedrich Nietzsche</a> (1844-1900), a philosopher who to many people merely advocated creativity and individuality.  But his claim was really that conventionality morality was a "slave morality" that existed only to prevent the strong from going "beyond good and evil" and doing what they liked.  Nietzsche's <I>&Uuml;bermensch</I> or "Superman" (now often translated "Overman") was then expected to create his own values and ignore conventional good and evil.  These ideas were an inspiration for Leopold and Loeb (teenagers who murdered a child, Bobby Franks, in 1924 to show that they were "beyond good and evil"), Adolf Hitler, and eventually the Los Angeles serial murderer the "Nightstalker," Richard Ramirez, who told the court at his murder trial that his victims were "worms" and that he was "beyond good and evil."  But does Krishna mean the same thing as Nietzsche when we see the same phrase in verse 17?  Certainly not.  When it comes to <I><B>action</B></I>, one must do one's <I>dharma</I>, which is to do what is right.  Krishna is simply not talking about action.  Brahman and so salvation are beyond action, beyond <I>dharma</I>, beyond karma, and so "beyond good and evil."  Nietzsche's theory would be as horrifying to Krishna as it should be to us.
</ul><p>

<li><H2>Chapter 13</H2>
<ul>
<li>24-25  Here is the only <I>list</I> of yogas in the <I>Gita</I>.<p>

<li>24.  "Some by the Yoga of meditation" -- this is dhy&acirc;nayoga -- "some by the Yoga of the vision of Truth" -- this is j&ntilde;&acirc;nayoga -- "and others by the Yoga of work" -- karmayoga.  Here we <I><B>already</B></I> have three yogas, the traditional number for the <I>Gita</I>, before we even get to bhaktiyoga.  Dhy&acirc;nayoga is the anomaly.  It is traditionally interpreted as <I><B>part</B></I> of j&ntilde;&acirc;nayoga, but obviously that move is not dictated by the text.  The word "dhy&acirc;na" is noteworthy because, in Buddhism, it is carried to China, where it is pronounced "<I>ch'an</I>," <img src="images/zen-7.gif" align=middle>.  That became the proper name of a Chinese <a href="divebomb.htm">school</a> of Buddhism, which spread to Korea (pronounced <I>S&otilde;n</I> [<I>Seon</I>] in Korean), Japan (<I>Zen</I>), and Vietnam (<I>Th&igrave;&ecirc;n</I>).<p>

<li>25.  "Hear from others and adore....devotion to words of Truth" -- bhaktiyoga.  Notice that this is not actually <I>called</I> a yoga, though "they also cross beyond death."
</ul><p>

<li><H2>Chapter 14</H2>
<ul>
<li>5.  "SATTVA [<img src="images/greek/guna-1.gif" align=middle>], RAJAS [<img src="images/greek/guna-2.gif" align=middle>], TAMAS [<img src="images/greek/guna-2.gif" align=middle>]"  A whole chapter about the gu&#x1e47;as.  "Light, fire, and darkness."  The gu&#x1e47;as are more interesting on their psychological side:  Sattva as the desire for goodness and knowledge (like Plato's Reason), rajas as the desire for action (like Plato's Spirit), and tamas as sloth, dullness, ignorance, etc. (comparable to Plato's Desire, though there is no reason why Desire should not be quite active and even intelligent -- the gu&#x1e47;as are <I>all</I> forms of desire).  Note that even Sattva is a form of bondage, while Plato's Reason was the means to every good end.<p>

<li>6-9.  Description of the gu&#x1e47;as.  The key term is "bind" -- each gu&#x1e47;a is a form of bondage, as is then repeated in verse 9.<p>

<li>20.  "When he goes beyond the three conditions of nature..."  Liberation or salvation is then liberation <I>from</I> the gu&#x1e47;as.  "Birth, old age, and death, and sorrow."  Sounds like the forms of suffering specified by Buddhism.
</ul><p>

<li><H2>Chapter 16</H2>
<ul>
<li>7.  "Evil men."  This looks like a reference to Buddhists, since the "evil men" are described in the ways that Buddhists are elsewhere typically characterized.  The only alternative is that despised "materialists" are referred to, but they were not important enough to rate this kind of mention in the <I>Gita</I>.<p>

<li>8.  "They say:  'This world has no truth, no moral foundation...'"  Radhakrishnan and Moore translate this, "the world is unreal, without a basis."  Reality to Buddhism, indeed, has no substance, essence, or identity, and no <I>dharma</I> as understood by Hinduism.  Buddhism was always characterized as producing instant social chaos and wickedness for denying the <I>dharmas</I> of the caste system.  "No God."  There is no Brahman, &Acirc;tman, or personal God in Buddhism.  "There is no law of creation:  what is the cause of birth but lust?"  Radhakrishnan and Moore say, "Not brought about in regular causal sequence, caused by desire, in short."  In Buddhism, all of apparent reality, and all of suffering, is caused by desire.  There is, however, a "regular causal sequence" in Buddhism, the principle of <I>Dependent Origination</I>; but that might not be taken seriously by Hinduism, since it holds that everything causes everything else, while Hinduism wants a source with the Creator.
</ul><p>

<li><H2>Chapter 17</H2>
<ul>
<li>Another chapter on the gu&#x1e47;as.  Since the gu&#x1e47;as constitute all of nature, there will tend to be <I>three</I> of everything:  three kinds of faith (2), food, sacrifice, harmony, gifts (7), etc.  In China, the five elements inspire similar ideas that there are <I>fives</I> of everything.  This is not entirely consistent in India:  there are often three of a certain thing (Vedas, varnas), but then with the fourth, slightly different in kind, added (the Atharva Veda, the &#x015a;udras).
</ul><p>

<li><H2>Chapter 18</H2>
<ul>
<li>17.  "Even if he kills all these warriors he kills them not and he is free."  The final chapter gets back to the point of Arjuna fighting the battle, killing his relatives, yet achieving salvation at the same time.<p>

<li>41-48.  An extraordinary passage on the <a href="caste.htm">caste system</a>.  Brahmins and Kshatriyas sound engaged in noble undertakings, what Vaishyas are about is pretty prosaic, and &#x015a;udras have no more to aspire to than "service."  Untouchables, of course, do not get mentioned.<p>

<li>47.  "Greater is thine own work, even if this be humble, than the work of another, even if this be great."  A very different sense may be found in the Radhakrishnan and Moore translation, "Better is one's own law though imperfectly carried out than the law of another carried out perfectly."  Certainly, if one isn't very good at what one does and can do something else better, one should change jobs.  But, remember, work goes "beyond what is well done and is not well done."  All that counts is doing one's own <I>dharma</I>, not someone else's.  "The work God gives him."  The work God gives you is the work that you a born with, since the caste system is a system of hereditary professions.  Radhakrishnan and Moore like to argue that <I>varna</I> is not about birth, just about natural aptitude.  "The <I>varna</I>, or the order to which we belong, is independent of sex, birth, and breeding" (p. 117 note).  But there was no social or legal recognition of natural aptitude in traditional India.  You were born into a <I>j&acirc;ti</I>, a caste, and this was already a traditional subcaste of a particular <I>varna</I>, if there was a <I>varna</I> at all (there wouldn't be for Untouchables).  The desire to rationalize away the evils of the caste system is understandable, but it is historically inaccurate and so a dishonest representation of traditional India.  It also misrepresents another reason why there is no reason to do another's work, even if it can be done better:  good or ill fortune depends on <I>karma</I>, not on talent or productivity.  We might think that life will get better if people do what they are good at, but traditional India did not believe in progress:  if things are good or bad, it is because of <I>karma</I>, not because the GNP isn't growing fast enough.<p>

<li>48.  "And a man should not abandon his work, even if he cannot achieve it in full perfection."  Same point.  If he can't do it well and doesn't like it, he should be looking for a different job.<p>

<li>72.  "Hast thou heard these words, Arjuna?"  Krishna finishes his discourse and asks if Arjuna is now ready to fight.<p>

<li>73.  "My doubts are no more...and now I can say 'Thy will be done'."

<br><B>Set thy heart upon thy work, but never on its reward. /<br>
Work not for a reward; but never cease to do thy work.</B></center>

<P>I did not have a hope of understanding the grammar of this passage, or even of what words into which to divide it, without the help of the Sanskritist Herman Tull.

<P>The first word is <img src="images/greek/karman.gif" align=middle>, <I>karman</I>, used in the locative <a href="cognates.htm#note-1">case</a>, <I>karma&#x1e47;i</I>.  This means "action" or "work" (the familiar "<a href="karma.htm">karma</a>").  The "i" gets written as a "y" at the beginning of the next word.  That word is <img src="images/greek/eva.gif" align=middle>, <I>eva</I>, an emphatic particle, "so, just so," etc.  Next is <img src="images/greek/adhikara.gif" align=middle>, <I>adhik&acirc;ra</I>, "concern, striving, endeavour for" (which takes the locative, as here with <I>karman</I>).  Next we get <I>te</I>, which is the genitive or possessive form of <img src="images/greek/tva.gif" align=middle>, <I>tvam</I>, the word for "you."  <img src="images/greek/ma.gif" align=middle>, <I>m&acirc;</I>, is the negative, "not."  Then comes <img src="images/greek/phala.gif" align=middle>, <I>phala</I>, "fruit, result, or reward," used as <I>phale&#x1e63;u</I>, the locative plural.  The line ends with <img src="images/greek/kadacana.gif" align=middle>, <I>kad&acirc;cana</I>, "some time, ever," which with the previous negative will mean "never."

<P>Thus, the first line of the verse, Juan Mascar&oacute;'s "Set thy heart on thy work," we could render more literally as "your concern is with the act."  "Never on its reward," substitutes "reward" for "fruit," which has the potential of sounding silly, and less to the point, in English.  The most familiar example of something like this in English is Matthew 7:20, "Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them."  Jesus, however, appears to mean "consequences" rather than "reward."

<P>The second line of the verse begins with <I>m&acirc;</I> again, and then <img src="images/greek/karphale.gif" align=middle>, <I>karmaphalahetur</I>, a compound that would mean the "cause/impulse for the fruit of action," where <I>karman</I> and <I>phala</I> are already familiar and <img src="images/greek/hetu.gif" align=middle>, <I>hetu</I> is "cause, motive."  The next word, <I>bh&ucirc;r</I>, is the <a href="system.htm#note-1">aorist</a> injunctive of <img src="images/greek/bhu.gif" align=middle>, <I>bh&ucirc;</I>, "be" (and a cognate of "be" itself).  In both <I>karmaphalahetur</I> and <I>bh&ucirc;r</I> the final "r" is a euphonic transformation (Sanskrit <I>sandhi</I>) of nominative "s" because of the labials ("bh" and "m") in the following words.

<P>Then we get <I>m&acirc;</I> and <I>te</I> again, followed by <I>sango</I>, from <img src="images/greek/sangas.gif" align=middle>, <I>sanga</I>, "desire, attachment" -- the "o" is another euphonic transformation of nominative "-as" followed by (elided) "a."  Next is <img src="images/greek/ast.gif" align=middle>, <I>astu</I>, the third person imperative of <I>as</I>, "be," which is <a href="cognates.htm">cognate</a> to "is" in English (the Sanskrit "a" was an "e" in Proto-Indo-European, which turns up as "i" in <a href="germania.htm#proto">Germanic</a> languages).  The "a" at the beginning of <I>astu</I> is elided with the <I>avagraha</I> sign, <img src="images/greek/avagra.gif" align=middle>.  As the "i" in <I>karma&#x1e47;i</I> above becomes a "y" on the following word, the "u" here becomes a "v" on the following "a."  Finally, we find <img src="images/greek/akarman.gif" align=middle>, <I>akarma&#x1e47;i</I>, the privative (with the prefixed <I>a</I> -- the "alpha privative" in Greek, making a negative) of <I>karman</I> in the locative again.

<P>What Juan Mascar&oacute; translates as, "Work not for a reward," Dr. Tull suggests can be rendered, "Let there not arise the impulse for the fruit of action."  "But never cease to do thy work," in turn, could be, "For you let there not be attachment to non-action."  Mascar&oacute;'s translation is not very literal, but it does not appear to distort the meaning at all.

<H1 ALIGN="center"><img src="images/om.gif" align=left><img src="images/om.gif" align=right>The Major and Minor Books of the <I>Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata</I><br>and Synopsis</H1>

<p><center><img src="images/key.gif"></center>

<P>The <I>Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata</I>, <img src="images/greek/sanskrtc.gif" align=middle> (<I>M&#x01dd;habhar&#x01dd;t</I> in <a href="upan.htm#hindi">Hindi</a>), may be the longest epic is world history.  And there is even a saying, "Everything that ever happened is in the <I>Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata</I>."  There is even a version of the companion epic, the <img src="images/greek/ramayana.gif" align=middle>, within the <I>Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata</I>.  Part of the reason for all this is the idea in the Indian tradition that all events are <a href="gods.htm#note-4">cyclical</a>, so that anything that has ever happened happens over and over again, like <a href="nietzsch.htm">Nietzsche's</a> "eternal recurrence."  Thus, "history" does not consist of unique events and does not need to be recorded as such -- as indeed it wasn't, to the frustration of modern historians.  The <I>Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata</I> and the <I>Ramay&acirc;na</I>, as the "Fifth <a href="upan.htm#veda">Veda</a>," contain the archetype and the paradigm for any other history.

<P>The <I>Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata</I> is supposed to have been composed by the Sage <img src="images/greek/vyasa.gif" align=middle>, whose anomalous parentage is also recounted in the epic, and where he is a participant himself.  The Indian equivalent of Homer, Vy&acirc;sa is thus likewise of legendary status, with elements of the <a href="miracles.htm">miraculous</a> that attend Indian sages.

<P>The J.A.B. van Buitenen (1928-1979) translation of the <I>Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata</I> at three volumes, for the University of Chiago Press remains incomplete due to his tragic untimely death (aged 51 years).  The Press continued the task of completing the planned volumes by distributing them to different scholars, certainly with the hope to speed things along.  However, completion of the project, which will render the unabridged Epic, as promised by the Press, has still been slow, with release dates for subsequent volumes getting postponed.  Volume 7, containing Books 11 and 12 (Part 1), translated by <a href="http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Sanskrit_in_Classics_at_Brown/Mahabharata/">James L. Fitzgerald</a>, was published in 2003.  I cannot find any other volumes yet, which seems like an extraordinary delay, since that was already fifteen years ago as I write.

<P>A project closer to being complete is the edition of the <I>Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata</I> for the Clay Sanskrit Library, which is published by the New York University Press and the JJC Foundation.  Like the Loeb Classical Library with Greek and Latin, and in similar sized volumes, this gives the Sanskrit text and the translation on facing pages, although the Sanskrit is transcribed and not in Denanagari.  The publications of the Library were begun in 2005.  So far, the following volumes of the <I>Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata</I>, from several different translators, are in print:  Part II, "The Great Hall"; Part III, "The Forest" (volume four of four); Part IV, "Virta"; Part V, "Preparations for War" (volume one); Part V, "Preparations for War (volume two); Part VI, "Bhishma" (volume one), Including the Bhagavad Gita in Context; Part VI, "Bhishma" (volume two); Part VII, "Drona" (volume one of four); Part VII, "Drona" (volume two of four); Part VIII, "Karna" (volume one); Part VIII, "Karna" (volume two); Part IX, "&#x015a;alya" (volume one); Part IX, "&#x015a;alya" (volume two); Part X-XI, "Dead of Night & The Women"; Part XII, "Peace" (volume three of five).  Thus, there are several missing volumes, but from different parts of the epic, perhaps giving one a better feel for the whole than what is available in the Chicago translation.

<P>The Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata ("Great Bharatas") is virtually the national epic of India.  It is the story of a civil war in the Bh&acirc;rata, <img src="images/greek/bharat.gif" align=middle>, clan, and it contains the <I>Bhagavad Gita</I> (minor book number 63), which is used in my <a href="valley/#1">Introduction to Philosophy</a> class.  The <I>Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata</I> is perhaps the largest epic in world literature, with 100,000 some verses.  It is divided into 18 major and 100 minor books, listed at left.

<P>Since "India" is Greek, <img src="images/greek/india.gif">, and the other common name for the country, "Hindustan," is Persian, <img src="images/greek/hindust2.gif" align=middle> (<I>Hendust&acirc;n</I>), when <a href="sangoku.htm#india">India</a> became independent in 1947, "Bh&acirc;rat" was
chosen to be the official name of the country.  We get "Bh&acirc;rat" rather than "Bh&acirc;rata" because short final <I>a</I>'s are not pronounced in Hind&icirc;:  &nbsp;thus you may see Arjuna called "Arjun," Bh&icirc;ma "Bh&icirc;m," and the Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata itself "Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rat."

<P>After some background, the story begins when the heir of the Bh&acirc;ratas, <img src="images/greek/bhishma.gif" align=middle>, whose mother is actually the goddess <img src="images/greek/ganges.gif" align=middle>, the Ganges River, renounces both the kingship and marriage.  This is so that his father can be remarried to a woman, <img src="images/greek/satyavat.gif" align=middle>, who requires that the succession to the throne go through her children and that there be no conflict about it, i.e. no alternative heirs.  The conflict comes later.  Bh&icirc;&#x1e63;ma is named after the Oath he swears of celibacy, for which the gods grant him, not exactly immortality, but his choice of when to die.

<P>After the natural heirs, Satayvat&icirc;'s sons, for whom all this trouble was generated, die untimely deaths, the dynasty is continued by the later heirs not being conceived by their mother's husband, who has died, but by the Sage Vy&acirc;sa himself as a substitute.

<P>Bh&icirc;&#x1e63;ma had seized three princesses for his half-brother's wives, <img src="images/greek/amba.gif" align=middle>, <img src="images/greek/ambika.gif" align=middle>, and <img src="images/greek/ambalika.gif" align=middle>.  He releases Amb&acirc; as betrothed to another -- by whom she is nevertheless rejected, leaving her vowing eternal vengeance on Bh&icirc;sma.  Bh&icirc;&#x1e63;ma ends up with two nephews, <img src="images/greek/drtarash.gif" align=middle> and <img src="images/greek/pandu.gif" align=middle>.

<P>Because the Sage is frightening in the unkempt state of a <a href="caste.htm#ascetic">Wandering Ascetic</a>, covered with ashes, Dh&#x1e5b;tar&acirc;&#x1e63;&#x1e6d;ra's mother, Ambik&acirc;, closes her eyes during their union, and the child is born blind.  This is why Vy&acirc;sa wanted to clean up before performing this service, but he was told not to.  P&acirc;&#x1e47;&#x1e0d;u's mother, Amb&acirc;lik&acirc;, is warned, but she pales in her fright, and the child is born pale (which is his name) and perhaps sickly.  For good measure, Vy&acirc;sa also impregates the maid, who gives birth to a half-brother who becomes the wise counselor of the realm.

<P>Dh&#x1e5b;tar&acirc;&#x1e63;&#x1e6d;ra becomes the father of 100 sons, called the Kurus or Kauravas.  These are born from the earth, since Dh&#x1e5b;tar&acirc;&#x1e63;&#x1e6d;ra's wife, <img src="images/greek/ghandari.gif" align=middle> who wears a blindfold to share her husband's blindness, gave birth to a large ball of flesh, which was divided into 100 pieces that were planted like seeds.  These grew into babies.

<P>P&acirc;&#x1e47;&#x1e0d;u, although the younger brother, succeeds to the throne because of his brother's blindness, but then he abdicates after falling under a curse that he cannot sleep with his two wives, or he will die.  Although married to two women, P&acirc;&#x1e47;&#x1e0d;u displays a curious reluctance to consumate his marriages.  They all take a "vacation" as <a href="caste.htm#forest">Forest Dwellers</a> to see if P&acirc;&#x1e47;&#x1e0d;u can get relaxed or aroused enough to do what he should.  Before that can happen, P&acirc;&#x1e47;&#x1e0d;u rushes off on the hunt at the word of a tiger nearby.  Unfortunately, what he shoots is not a tirger, but a Sage and his wife, who have taken the form of deer to make love.  The curse is from the Sage, who denies to P&acirc;&#x1e47;&#x1e0d;u the joy that he denied to them.  With his wives, P&acirc;&#x1e47;&#x1e0d;u thus retires permanently to the Forest, and Dh&#x1e5b;tar&acirc;&#x1e63;&#x1e6d;ra becomes king after all.

<P>Kunt&icirc;, <img src="images/greek/kunti.gif" align=middle>, P&acirc;&#x1e47;&#x1e0d;u's elder wife, has a secret.  She possesses a spell that enables her to call down the gods; and P&acirc;&#x1e47;&#x1e0d;u agrees that she should conceive children by them.  The god Dharma (duty) begets <img src="images/greek/yudhistr.gif" align=middle>, V&acirc;yu (the wind) begets  <img src="images/greek/bhima.gif" align=middle>, and Indra begets <img src="images/greek/arjuna.gif" align=middle>. Using the same device P&acirc;&#x1e47;&#x1e0d;u's second wife, <img src="images/greek/madri.gif" align=middle>, M&acirc;dr&icirc;, calls down the twin gods the Ashvins who beget the twins <img src="images/greek/nakula.gif" align=middle> and <img src="images/greek/sahadeva.gif" align=middle>.

<P>Doubtlessly frustrated by all this going on, and seeing M&acirc;dr&icirc; bathing, P&acirc;&#x1e47;&#x1e0d;u then attempts to copulate with her, and he dies.  M&acirc;dr&icirc; joins him on the funeral pyre (a case of "<a href="caste.htm#note-1">suttee</a>"), and Kunt&icirc; is left to raise the five sons, each a <img src="images/greek/pandava.gif" align=middle>, in their uncle's court, to which she returns.

<P>Kunt&icirc;, as it happens, had used her spell before she was married.  She had a son, named <img src="images/greek/karna.gif" align=middle>, by S&ucirc;rya, the sun god.  Fearing disgrace, she set Kar&#x1e47;a floating down the river in a basket (like Moses or the great Mesopotamian king <a href="notes/oldking.htm#sumer">Sargon of Akkad</a>).  Kar&#x1e47;a was raised by a royal chariot-driver.  After growing up, sensing his own power, Kar&#x1e47;a tries to participate in a royal tournament, but he is snubbed as a commoner by the P&acirc;&#x1e47;&#x1e0d;avas.  He is then accepted as a friend and equal by the eldest of the Kurus, <img src="images/greek/duryodha.gif" align=middle>, to spite the P&acirc;&#x1e47;&#x1e0d;avas.  This will have tragic results, as Kar&#x1e47;a refuses to be disloyal to Duryodhana, even after learning the truth of his own origin and understanding the wrongness of Duryodhan'a cause.

<P>Besides the curious nature of their parentage, another odd feature about the P&acirc;&#x1e47;&#x1e0d;avas is that they all share the same wife, Draupad&icirc;, <img src="images/greek/draupadi.gif" align=middle>.  Draupad&icirc;'s father wanted her to marry Arjuna, so he set up a bride contest where suitors were required to string a bow that had been made so powerful that only Arjuna, presumably, could do so and then achieve a difficult shot, again, presumably, that only Arjuna would be able to do.  This is reminiscent of a similar situation in the <I>Odyssey</I>, where Penelope, awaiting the long overdue return of Odysseus from Troy, requires that suitors for her hand string Odysseus's bow.  They cannot do it; and when Odysseus does return (after twenty years), he strings the bow and then shoots them all.  Arjuna, as it happens, strings the bow, makes the shot, and wins Draupad&icirc;'s hand.  But when he returns home and announces to his mother that he has won something, Kunt&icirc;, who thinks the boys have been out getting some food, says that he must share it with his brothers.  Since Kunt&icirc; is a queen, she cannot take back her order, so Draupad&icirc; marries all five P&acirc;&#x1e47;&#x1e0d;avas.  Their agreement, however, is that only one husband sleeps with Draupad&icirc; at a time and that the other husbands cannot even enter the room when Draupad&icirc; is with one.

<P>While they grew up together, the eldest Kuru, Duryodhana, became jealous of his cousins -- with Yudhi&#x1e63;&#x1e6d;hira, the eldest cousin, actually the heir to the Throne -- and over the years continually plots to kill or dispossess them.  Even as a child, he drugs Bh&icirc;ma and throws him in the river to drown.  Unfortunately, Bh&icirc;ma is related to the Nagas, semi-human serpents, who rescue him and endow him with the strength of ten elephants.  Although the story sometimes seems to forget that he has this strength, he does display it occasionally, to spectacular effect.

<P>Eventually Duryodhana tricks Yudhi&#x1e63;&#x1e6d;hira into a crooked dice game, run by Gh&acirc;nd&acirc;r&icirc;'s venegeful brother (who blames the Bh&acirc;ratas for his sister's assumed blindness), who cheats him out of the half of the kingdom that Dh&#x1e5b;tar&acirc;&#x1e63;&#x1e6d;ra had bestowed on the P&acirc;&#x1e47;&#x1e0d;avas and even out of their and Draupad&icirc;'s own freedom.  <a href="sangoku.htm#dress"><img src="images/draupadi.jpg" align=right width=220 border=0></a>Then he insults Draupad&icirc; by asking his brother, Du&#x1e25;&#x015b;&acirc;sana, to pull off her clothes.  In a famous scene, Draupad&icirc;'s clothes are miraculously restored as they are pulled off.  Although the text does not say so (and K&#x1e5b;&#x1e63;&#x1e47;a is not even present), this miracle is believed by the pious to have been effected by the Lord K&#x1e5b;&#x1e63;&#x1e47;a (<img src="images/greek/krishna.gif" align=middle>, Krishna in Hind&icirc;), a king and friend of Arjuna.  Arjuna had taken K&#x1e5b;&#x1e63;&#x1e47;a's sister, <img src="images/greek/subhadra.gif" align=middle>, as a second wife.

<P>But K&#x1e5b;&#x1e63;&#x1e47;a is more than he seems:  &nbsp;He is really an incarnation of God -- as God is conceived in sectarian form as <a href="gods.htm">Vi&#x1e63;&#x1e47;u</a>.  When Du&#x1e25;&#x015b;&acirc;sana gives up trying to strip Draupad&icirc;, Bh&icirc;ma, the most physically powerful brother (who later will crush a man into a small ball for insulting Draupad&icirc;) vows that he is going to kill him, tear open his chest, and drink his blood.  Draupad&icirc; herself vows that she will wash her hair in Du&#x1e25;&#x015b;&acirc;sana's blood.   G&acirc;ndh&acirc;r&icirc; is shocked that things have been allowed to go this far, and Dh&#x1e5b;tar&acirc;&#x1e63;&#x1e6d;ra restores the freedom of the P&acirc;&#x1e47;&#x1e0d;avas and Draupad&icirc;.  However, Duryodhana challenges Yudhi&#x1e63;&#x1e6d;hira to a last bet, that the P&acirc;&#x1e47;&#x1e0d;avas must go into exile for twelve years and into hiding for one, or forfeit their kingdom.  Yudhi&#x1e63;&#x1e6d;hira loses, but then the P&acirc;&#x1e47;&#x1e0d;avas successfully complete the exile.  Duryodhana refuses to restore their kingdom.  That, and the recollection of the insults and humiliations of the dice game, results in war:  &nbsp;the eleven armies of the Kurus against the seven armies of the P&acirc;&#x1e47;&#x1e0d;avas.

<P>The Lord K&#x1e5b;&#x1e63;&#x1e47;a offers a choice to Duryodhana, either he can have K&#x1e5b;&#x1e63;&#x1e47;a's armies or K&#x1e5b;&#x1e63;&#x1e47;a himself as a non-combatant advisor and charioteer.  Duryodhana foolishly takes the armies; but Arjuna is wisely pleased to have K&#x1e5b;&#x1e63;&#x1e47;a.  The <I>Bhagavad Gita</I> takes place as the battle between the Kurus and P&acirc;&#x1e47;&#x1e0d;avas is about to start.  Arjuna asks K&#x1e5b;&#x1e63;&#x1e47;a to drive their chariot out between the armies so he can see them all.  But, seeing them, Arjuna decides that he does not want to fight and kill his relatives and friends after all.  The entire <I>Gita</I> is then K&#x1e5b;&#x1e63;&#x1e47;a explaining why Arjuna <B>must</B> fight and how he <B>can</B> fight and achieve salvation at the same time.

<P>In the battle, the P&acirc;&#x1e47;&#x1e0d;avas kill all the Kurus and win the whole kingdom.  However, it is at great cost.  All the sons of the P&acirc;&#x1e47;&#x1e0d;avas and Draupad&icirc;, Draupad&icirc;'s father and brothers, and Arjuna and Subhadr&acirc;'s son, are killed.  Arjuna unwittingly kills his own brother, Kar&#x1e47;a, who labors under various curses that he has undeservedly acquired.  The loyalty of many in the Kuru army, including Bh&icirc;&#x1e63;ma and Dro&#x1e47;a, to the Throne also overrides their judgment that it is the wrong cause.

<P>An intriguing feature of the battle is that at key points K&#x1e5b;&#x1e63;&#x1e47;a advises the P&acirc;&#x1e47;&#x1e0d;avas to gain advantages by violating the rules of the war.  Thus, when Kar&#x1e47;a's chariot sinks into the ground (because of a curse), and Kar&#x1e47;a is on foot trying to dislodge it, which should, by agreement, make him immune to attack, K&#x1e5b;&#x1e63;&#x1e47;a tells Arjuna to shoot him.  Arjuna balks, but K&#x1e5b;&#x1e63;&#x1e47;a taunts and exhorts him.  Arjuna finally shoots and kills the luckless and tragic Kar&#x1e47;a.

<P>Later, K&#x1e5b;&#x1e63;&#x1e47;a urges Bh&icirc;ma, who has fared poorly in combat with Duryodhana, to break the Kuru's legs with his club.  Again, by agreement, strikes below the belt have been ruled out; but Bh&icirc;ma obeys, and so Duryodhana is disabled and left to die.  Curiously, like Achilles, Duryodhana had been rendered invulnerable to harm, when Gh&acirc;nd&acirc;r&icirc; uncovered her eyes and looked upon him, with her accumulated power, one and only one time.  She had instructed him to stand naked, but Duryodhana had modestly covered his loins, which thus were unaffected.  This is where Bh&icirc;ma strikes him.

<P>The P&acirc;&#x1e47;adavas already had to deal with Bh&icirc;&#x1e63;ma and Dro&#x1e47;a, whom they could not defeat in open combat.   Bh&icirc;&#x1e63;ma is undone by the vengeance of Ambh&acirc;, who is reincarned as a man, and appears in the battle, but whom Bh&icirc;&#x1e63;ma recognizes and will not shoot.  Behind her(/him), Arjuna immobilizes Bh&icirc;&#x1e63;ma by filling him with arrows, so that he lies on the "bed" of arrows until deciding to die, after the battle and after instructing the P&acirc;&#x1e47;adavas in political wisdom.

<P><img src="images/greek/drona.gif" align=middle>, the teacher of the P&acirc;&#x1e47;&#x1e0d;avas and Kurus, is defeated when K&#x1e5b;&#x1e63;&#x1e47;a persuades Yudhi&#x1e63;&#x1e6d;hira -- who, like George Washington, cannot tell a lie -- to lie to Dro&#x1e47;a that his son, A&#x015b;vatth&acirc;m&acirc;, has been killed.  Dro&#x1e47;a is undone, lets his weapons drop, and is killed by Draupad&icirc;'s brother, who has his own reasons for vengeance.

<P>K&#x1e5b;&#x1e63;&#x1e47;a's willingness to break faith in order that the better side should win is reminiscent of the counsel of <a href="machiav.htm">Machiavelli</a>.  Similarly, the willingness to go beyond the rules of war in a good cause, together with the other associations of the <I>Bhagavad Gita</I> with it, draw us back to the <a href="ross/trinity.htm">Trinity Site</a>, where the first atomic bomb was detonated.  Indeed, the battle ends when A&#x015b;vatth&acirc;m&acirc; casts a celestial weapon, the A&#x1e63;&icirc;ka weapon, powerful enough to destroy the universe, to kill, in revenge for his father, the grandson of Arjuna, through Subhadr&acirc;, in the very womb of his mother Uttar&acirc;.  This is what happens.  But K&#x1e5b;&#x1e63;&#x1e47;a says that it cannot be allowed to be, and he brings the baby back to life.

<P>The moral ambivalence of the Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata, reminiscent of the fifth characteristic of <a href="greek.htm#morally">mytho-poeic thought</a>, and so true to life, contributes to its power.  It is triumphant and tragic at once, where good wins out but at a great cost in fortune and conscience, and with some acknowledgement of the virtues of the enemy, especially with those like Bh&icirc;&#x1e63;ma, Dro&#x1e47;a, and Kar&#x1e47;a who are good themselves but <a href="poly-1.htm#note-2"><font color="#eeaa00"><B>honor-bound</B></font></a> to fight on the wrong side.  The moral ambiguity of the story is continued afterwards, where the rewards of Heaven do not seem to always match the desserts of the Kurus and P&acirc;&#x1e47;&#x1e0d;avas.

<P>I am familiar with two video versions of the <I>Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata</I> in Hindi, one from 1988 in 94 episdoes, produced by B.R. and Ravi Chopra, and one from 2013, produced by Swastik [! <img src="images/greek/swastik1.gif" align=middle>!] Produdctions Pvt. Ltd.  The former was too early for much sophistication in special effects, which are generally cheesy and sometimes ludicrous.  However, the casting and acting are brilliant, and the story is presented in some detail.  The 2013 production, naturally, excels in special effects and is beautifully done, but it leaves out large parts of the story, perhaps to avoid the strange, uncomfortable, or embarrassing features of the original epic.  There is a little of that in the 1988 version, which avoids the story of the odd origin of the Kurus and skips over the case of suttee on the part of Madr&icirc;.  However, the 2013 version gives us almost no information about the birth of any of the major characters, without even the detail of Dh&#x1e5b;tar&acirc;&#x1e63;&#x1e6d;ra being born blind, or why that happened.  Instead, we get largely irrelevant comments to the audience from Krishna, long before he is even introduced into the story.  I do not find that helpful, or even interesting.  Thus, the 1988 version remains superior, despite the demands it makes on more sophisticated viewers.

<P>An ambitious version of the <I>Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata</I> as a play was first staged, in French, in 1985.  It was translated into English by director Peter Brook in 1987 and performed thereafter for two years, on world tours, in both French and English.  The play was nine hours long, expanded to eleven hours with breaks.  With an international cast, it transformed the story into a world, not just an Indian, epic.  It contains some details that the Hindi versions do not have, including a treatment of the story <I>after</I> the battle, which the 1988 Hindi version completely skips.  But the play also reduces the <I>Bhagavad Gita</I> to about five minutes, with little evident understanding of what it is all about.  A six hour version of the play was produced for a mini-series in 1989, later released on video; and a three or four hour version was then given a theaterical movie release.
