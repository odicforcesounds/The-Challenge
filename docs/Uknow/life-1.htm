<P>This page contains an image, involving human anatomy, that some may regard as offensive or inappropriate.  It is included because it is (1) funny, (2) apt, (3) addresses a feature of the human condition, namely that we belong to the natural system of the animals, and of the mammals in particular, and (4) it is <a href="erotic.htm" target="_top">aesthetically</a> appealing.  People who find this disturbing or objectionable may wish to read about <a href="decdenc1.htm" target="_top">decadence</a> instead.  Otherwise, see the note for Mammalia in the example classification for <I>Homo sapiens</I> below.  To view this page without the frame above, click <a href="life-1.htm" target="_top">here</a>.

<P>The following list covers, as far as I can determine, every living thing, not always down to much detail, of course.  This is an idiosyncratic and likely a dated treatment.  Idiosyncratic mainly because of the system of Superkingdoms and Kingdoms, which are novel, as explained.  Dated because most of my original sources are getting a little old.  I would like to keep up with the research and to update this page in a timely fashion, but I can't make this a full-time job and devote the attention it would require.  Parts get updated as particular things come to my attention, sometimes in relation to matters that diverge off into other issues, such as bureaucracy or human sexuality.  Since the purpose of the page is to give a general idea and an impression of the diversity of life, this is not harmed by not everything being up to date.  As awareness of the variety, age, and history of life is part of the basic motivation and evidence for the theory of <a href="creation.htm" target="_top">Evolution</a> by natural selection, it does not need to be entirely current to annoy the right people.  On the other hand, the notion of the superiority of modern life over ancient (both biological and cultural) is bound to annoy other kinds of people, although the full treatment of the matter is to be found <a href="order.htm" target="_top">elsewhere</a>.

<P>My first exposure to the big picture of life was in <I>The Wellsprings of Life</I> by the late and beloved <B>Isaac Asimov</B> [Signet Science Library, 1960], which I had assigned in a freshman Anthropology class at the University of New Mexico in 1967.  Another favorite old book was <I>Evolution of the Vertebrates</I> by Edwin H. Colbert [John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1955, 1969], which I had found while in high school.   Both books may be too out of date, especially Colbert -- although my affection for them persists and I still have them at hand.  But the source I have initially used the most here is <I>Five Kingdoms, An Illustrated Guide to the Phyla of Life on Earth</I> by Lynn Margulis and Karlene V. Schwartz [W.H. Freeman and Company, 1982] -- a book that itself is likely to be rather dated, although not as much so and the issues are current.

<P><img src="images/clad-5.gif" align=left>The earliest ideas about the ultimate classification of material things may be like what we see at left, a division that we still hear occasionally, between animal, vegetable, and mineral.  This won't do as a division of life, of course, since the "mineral" part is inanimate.  <img src="images/clad-6.gif" align=right>Reducing this to "animal and vegetable" isn't exactly a revolution in biology, so that the steps are to notice that bacteria are very different from complex plants and animals, while eventually fungi began to look fundamentally different from regular, photosynethic plants.  Whether fungi had a common ancestor, perhaps independent of plants, would need to wait for genetic studies.

<P><img src="images/clad-7.gif" align=left>The five Kingdoms of Margulis and Schwartz are <B>Monera, Protoctista</B> (instead of Protista), <B>Plantae, Fungi, and Animalia</B>, as we see at left where the protozoans have been separated from both animals and bacteria.  The source of the "seven Kingdoms" idea on this page was a <I>Scientific American</I> article on the "archaebacteria," anaerobic and other peculiar bacteria that are like those that preexisted the oxygenation of the Earth's atmosphere [C. R. Woese, "Archaebacteria," <I>Scientific American</I>, June 1981, pp.98-122].  In a genealogy of life, these are importantly different from later bacteria.

They include the very unique chemosynthesizing bacteria that make an abundance of life possible at volcanic vents, "smokers," on mid-ocean ridges.  These sites and their fauna were entirely unknown until the late 1970's and open the prospect that life may have begun in the high temperatures and chemical rich environments of such places.  I have just seen mention (late 2002, on one of these science shows on the Discovery Channel or Science Channel) that a fundamental division of life into the archaic bacteria, regular bacteria, and everything else is now widely accepted.  All I have done here is introduce the most general divisions as "Superkingdoms," with two extra kingdoms for slime molds (beloved by all) and the archaebacteria.  The idea of the extinct Superkingdoms of primaeval cells and early eukatryotes was from specuation about such things in the <I>Scientific American</I> article.<br clear=left>

<P><img src="images/archaea.gif" align=left><a name="text-1">The first book I saw on all this was <I>The Third Domain, the Untold Story of Archaea and the Future of Biotechnology</I>, by Tim Friend [Joseph Henry Press, Washington, 2007].  The chart at left is featured in Friend's book [p.11] with a division based on DNA studies.  I have added color to highlight the differences, with the assumption that it is Archaebacteria at the "Origin," since they were necessarily anaerobic in an early atmosphere of little oxygen. [<a href="#note-1">note</a>]

<P>The idea of the three living Superkingdoms that I have used here is intended to represent the new understanding of the three large divisions of life, with two extinct Superkingdoms for transitional forms that now no longer exist.  The Superkingdoms are thus based on the stages in the evolution of structure of the cell.   Eukaryotic cells not only contain distinct nuclei but have organelles, small bodies like mitochondria and chloroplasts.  Since such organelles can contain their own genetic material, they may well have originated as separate organisms that came to live as symbiotes in host cells.  Instead of "Superkingdoms," it has already been suggested that the three living highest divisions of life be called "Domains."  Since "superkingdom" is not otherwise used, and I have added extinct categories, I would prefer "Superkingdom" over "Domain," but we shall see what catches on or is formally adopted.

<P>It also occurred in the <I>Scientific American</I> article that slime molds were rather different from what might have been associated with them earlier, the fungi or protista -- Margulis and Schwartz note that such separate classification can occur but don't themselves give slime molds a separate Kingdom.  With the new genetic studies, as displayed in Friend's book, a number of branches of life appear to be on about equal footing with slime molds, plants, animals, and fungi.  This could result in a great multiplication of Kingdoms, with six divisions instead of one for the Protista just within the Eukaryotes.  The following diagram from Friend's book [p.63] is more clearly labelled and does not leave unidentified branches as in the first diagram.  For the moment, I will resist the tempation to multiply the Kingdoms further -- holding at seven with only two added to Margulis and Schwartz for the Archaebacteria (preferentially "Archaea" in recent usage) and slime molds.  If organelles originate as symbiotes within the Eukaryotes, it is always possible that some of them were from the Eubacteria, which complicates a simple branching tree of life.  I have not yet attempted to adjust the main table below in light of the new information.  It still reflects what I gathered from the earlier sources.

<P><center><img src="images/archaea2.gif"></center>

<P><img src="images/clad-8.gif" align=right>The basic elements of the system of classification are in bold text below:  &nbsp;<B>Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, and species</B>.  The elaboration of this into so many intermediate categories now has progressed very far.  The following table illustrates the levels of classification for human beings (<B>Homo sapiens</B>).  I have modified this table in light of a recent article in <I>Science News</I> [March 29, 2003] that there has been a division introduced for the Primates since the work in other sources.  Tarsiers have now been removed from the Prosimians and grouped with monkeys and apes.  The division between this group (the Haplorhines) and the rest of the Primates (the Strepsirrhines) has even been dated, with DNA techniques, to between 80 and 90 million years ago.  This puts the groups in the range of Suborders.  So I have introduced them at that level, bumping the previous Suborders and Infraorders down one step.  This could be conveniently done, since the Parvorder level not had previously been used.  I have also seen in a <I>National Geographic</I> Magazine article on the mammals [April 2003] that recent DNA studies have radically regrouped the divisions of placential mammals [pp.14-15].  We get four broad groups, Afrotheria, Xenarthra, Laurasiatheria, and Euarchontoglires.  These groups match up with the way in which the Jurassic supercontinent, Pangaea, broke up (or reconnected, between Eurasia and Africa) over millions of years, with the groups corresponding, respectively, to Africa, South America, Eurasia and North American (i.e. Laurasia), and Eurasia and Africa.  As it happens these divisions can easily be incorporated as Superorders.  Previously, I had only used one Superorder (Placentalia) under the Infraclass Eutheria, but this was not logically meaningful, since it was coextensive.  The Eutheria were already the placentials.  Now this gives us more interesting distinctions.  I cannot know from the National Geographic information where some Orders, especially extinct ones, would belong, so I have simply left them under Laurasiatheria, which is the largest group.<br clear=right>

<P><a name="tyranno">Perhaps I need not have bothered with Orders, Infraorders, Suborders, etc.  The newest hot thing in biology and paleontology seems to be to abandon classification categories like Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, and Family, with all their subdivisions and supergroupings.  I've come across this in a recent book, <I>The Tyrannosaur Chronicles, the Biology of the Tyrant Dinosaurs</I> [Bloomsbury Sigma, 2016], by David Hone, who is a paleontologist at the University of London.  Hone says,

<P><blockquote>Few of the old taxonomic ranks of organisms (Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus and Species) are used by modern biologists and paleontologists.  While terms like 'the dog family' and 'Class Aves' still get bandied about, reserachers are increasingly abandoning them since they don't have clear equivalents between groups. [p.11]</blockquote>

<P>Instead of the traditional ranks, Hone indiscriminately uses "clades" (<img src="images/greek/kladoi.gif" align=middle>, singular <img src="images/greek/klados.gif" align=middle>, "branch," particularly a branch broken off) or "groups" for everything beyond Genera and species, although we do find the curious expression "major groups," glossed as "previously called families" [p.39].  A Family hardly seems like a "major group" in terms of the traditional hierarchy.  But then Hone uses the term "major groups" to refer to the "albertosaurines" and "tyrannosaurines," which would be subfamilies, not families [p.47].  This shifting and confusion is just what we would expect from Hone's new attitude.

<P>Now, in doing this Hone endorses the new techniques of "cladistic analysis" [p.45], without really explaining very much about them to us.  And, of course, it would be nice to see the traditional ranks, originally with no more than subjective motivations, brought up to date with more rigorous definitions, as in percentages of common DNA or in terms of time lapsed since a common ancestor (as in the diagram below).  But completely erasing the traditional ranks has a taste both of nihilism and of the kind of arrogance that summarily tossed out <I>Brontosaurus</I> from the taxonomy -- a sin that is all too evident in Hone himself, who refers to "famous names (such as <I>Diplodocus</I>, <I>Stegosaurus</I>, <I>Allosaurus</I>, and <I>Apatosaurus</I>)" [pp.26-27], where, of course, there was nothing "famous" about "<I>Apatosaurus</I>" until <I>Brontosaurus</I> fossils were stolen for it.  Late in his book, Hone does work <I>Brontosaurus</I> into a list of Sauropods, without comment, perhaps because he has become aware that the name has returned to the favored graces of paleontology.

<P>If cladistic diagrams can be developed with some rigor, this is an excellent development.  Biologists, however, are unlikely to recall that the result, with binary divisions, looks like one of the oldest techniques in logic, the <B>Porphyrian Tree</B>, whose conception really goes back to Plato but is named after the Neoplatonist <a href="hist-1.htm#late" target="_top">Porphyry</a>, who described it in his <I>Isagoge</I>, the "Introduction" to Aristotle's <I>Organon</I> of logical works.  It is in Porphyry that the nomenclature of "genus and species," which goes back to Aristotle and which Hone admits is still used in biology, is formally established.  And for Porphyry, all the levels of generality (<I>generalitas</I>) above <I>species</I> (pl. <I>species</I>) are <I>genera</I> (sing. <I>genus</I>).  The first genus, however, is the "promixate" genus, while all the others are "remote" genera [cf. <I>Basic Logic</I>, Raymond J. McCall, Barnes & Noble, 1952, 1967, p.8].  So the cladistic diagrams we see now are simply ranks of remote genera, and the remaining taxonomic rank of "Genus" is the proximate genus.

<P>In these terms, the traditional ranks of "Kingdom," etc., were simply trying to give us some perspective on how general our generalities were.  <a href="#tyranofam"><img src="images/clad-4.gif" align=left border=0></a>If Hone can refer to the Ornithischian and Saurischian dinosaurs as "clades" rather than "Orders" [p.39], this does leave us with no sense of how many layers of remote genera we have traversed from the species.  But he also continues to use the forms of traditional terminology, like "Tryannosauridae," without telling us that the "-idae" suffix, from the Greek <a href="greek.htm#note-22" target="_top">patronymic</a>, was always used distinctively for the names of biological Families.  Obscuring these principles is not helpful.  A name like "Tyrannosauridae" <I>pins</I> the system to a reference point.  How many divisions we then need below the Family level depends on the situation.  This is where cladistic analysis will help; but with our reference points at Family and Genus, we can fill in as many levels as we need, with reasonable terminology.  This sort of thing is evident at several points on this page.<br clear=right>

<P>The confusion that can result from Hone's approach is evident in his own list of the Genera and species of the Tyrannosauroidea [p.54], which I have reproduced <a href="#tyranofam">below</a> with appropriate ranks.  All the "clades" are lumped together by Hone in the same column, with the elimination of the Family "Tyrannosauridae" as, evidently, redundant.  What this means is that we cannot use Hone's own table to construct the relationships that we see in Hone's own earlier diagram of the Tyrannosauroidea [p.13 -- shown in the paragraph above, with glosses in red, blue, and purple].  This is not helpful, and it demonstrates the usefulness of the traditional ranks.  They do provide an orientation, and ideally they enable us go back and forth between a cladistic diagram and the taxonomic names.

<P><a name="text-2">Thus, I will continue wtih the traditional ranks, however subjective the assignments must sometimes be.  David Hone unintentionally demonstrates the drawbacks of giving them up.  <a href="notes/breast.htm"><img src="images/mammal.jpg" align=right border=0></a>However, I now see a use of "clade" that is new and helpful.  At Wikipedia there is often inserted a "clade" assignment into traditional classifications to indicate <I>descent</I> were this would otherwise not be shown without a diagram.  Thus, Mammals are under the "clade" of <a href="#synapsida">Synapsida</a>, mammal-like reptiles, because that looks like the point of derivation for Mammals.  Otherwise, it is awkward to indicate this since Mammalia is its own Class, while Synapsida is a Subclass of the Class <a href="#reptilia">Reptilia</a>.  In these terms, we would want to insert a "clade" for Dinosaurs under Infraclass <a href="#archosauria">Archosauria</a>, since that is actually where Dinosaurs used to be and it does indicate the probable point of their descent.  This is a very useful and innovative use of the "clade" concept.  So lets see what this looks like for human beings.  Porphyry would be proud:

<P>The levels of "parvorder" and "tribe" originally only occurred in one place in the following table, under the <a href="#perching">Order Passeriformes</a>, perching birds -- though the parvorder is now also used here, as just explained, for the Primates.  The classification for these birds is based on another article in <I>Scientific American</I>, which distinguished between the Corvida and the Passerida.  The most interesting feature was that the Corvida, ultimately including crows (Genus Corvus), evolved in Australia and, unlike other native Australian life forms, was able to then spread around the world.  The use of the "parvorder" and "tribe" levels also went along with an estimation, which is given in the table above, of the time elapsed since separation of the genealogy at that level.  With genetic analysis of DNA, this is now a promising means of determining relationships between all life forms and the age of various divisions.  If the purpose of the introduction of parvorder and tribe was to allow a steady gradient in time among the level of classification, then perhaps living genera separate at 10-20 million years ago, and species at up to 10 million years ago.  It is independently estimated that a species lasts about 5 million years, so that is in the right order of magnitude.

<P><img src="images/clad-1.gif" align=left>Speaking of the birds, <B>Aves</B> is given here as a Subclass rather than a Class as traditional, based on the idea that birds are dinosaurs, and that dinosaurs should no longer be classified as reptiles.  The traditional view of the classification is shown at left, where Dinosauria would be no more than a Superorder, over the two (or three) Orders of dinosaurs, with the derivation of birds subject to agnosticism but generally thought not to be from the dinosaurs.  The classification here thus uses <a href="#endosaur">Class Endosauropsida</a> for both dinosaurs and birds, borrowing the term from <I>The Hot-Blooded Dinosaurs</I>, by Adrian J. Desmond [Warner Books, 1975, 1977], <img src="images/clad-2.gif" align=right>one of the first books I saw with extensive discussion and argument for the warm blooded nature of dinosaurs (and <a href="#thecodont">Thecondonts</a>, which here are still left with the reptiles).  This idea for the reclassification is shown at right.  Later, I would say that the best book that turned up was <I>The Dinosaur Heresies</I> by practicing paleontologist <B>Robert T. Bakker</B> [William Morrow and Company, Inc., 1986] -- a bit of a Wild Child in paleontology, always sporting a bushy beard and battered cowboy hat.<br clear=left>

<P>It now seems to be generally accepted that birds are derived from dinosaurs.  This motivates putting dinosaurs and birds in the same class.  However, the dinosaurs have been gone for 65 million years, birds do seem to have a common ancestor, <img src="images/clad-3.gif" align=left>and I therefore tend to think that there is as much justification to separate birds from dinosaurs as mammals from reptiles.  So, although I have left Class Endosauropsida in the table below, I am beginning to prefer the grouping shown at left, with three whole classes derived from Reptilia.

<P>In a recent book, <I>My Beloved Brontosaurus, On the Road with Old Bones, New Science, and Our Favorite Dinosaurs</I> [Scientific American/Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2013], the author, Brian Switek, simply classifies birds with dinosaurs under the common Class of Dinosauria.  Because of this, he must always refer to dinosaurs proper in the book as "non-avian dinosaurs."  The constant repetition of this becomes tedious and is clumsy, unnecessary, and annoying.  David Hone, even without the traditional ranks, faces the same problem but avoids quite as much repetition.  But Reptiles are not "non-mammalian reptiles" just because mammals are derived from them.  By the same token, we could easily preserve Aves as a separate Class because of a unique characteristic, flight, that separates it from the dinosaurs (even modern flightless birds, with vestigial wings, derive from flying birds).  Thus, Adrian Desmond's Endosauropsida seems preferable, with Subclasses of Dinosauria and Aves.  Or just make them both Classes, as I have just suggested.  Birds are birds and dinosaurs are dinosaurs.  Birds have pulled dinosaurs out of the Subclass Diapsida into their own Sublass or Class.

<P><img src="images/clad-9.gif" align=right>Taking part of David Hone's diagram from page 66, we can consider some of the difficulties involved.  The only actual change I have made here is to place the node of "dinosaurs" above the branch for Pterosaurs, as well as where Hone has it, below.  In the main list, I do have the <a href="#pterosaurs">Pterosaurs</a> as an Order of dinosaurs.  Hone's own diagram makes it look like this is essentially an arbitrary decision, since he does have Pterosaurs as at least the most closely related Archosaurs to the dinosaurs.  The bigger difference, of course, is that I have considered how to assign the traditions taxonomic ranks to the diagram, while Hone does not need to.  We can elevate the Dinosauria from what would have been a traditional Superorder to a Subclass or even a Class in its own right.  This may look odd, having a Class as essentially a subdivision of the Infraclass Archosauria, but then Aves was itself always considered a Class, and now there is little doubt that it derives from the Theropods (as shown).  The previous uncertainty about its derivation helped it status as a Class, but then mammals were a Class also, and there was much less doubt about their derivation from the <a href="#synapsida">mammal-like reptiles</a>.  We must certainly think that Class status goes with radical modifications in morphology and physiology.  How this is to be quantified is a good question.  Even DNA analysis may not show much in the way of large differences.  Or it may.  In any case, what we subjectively perceive as "radical modifications" is likely to be something that can be given a mathematical expression in time, removing the subjective element.<br clear=right>

<P><a name="brontosaurus">Brian Switek's book stands as a loving farewell to the <I>Brontosaurus</I> that he knew in childhood.  The name had been abolished in an obscurantist rage to replace it with <I>Apatosaurus</I>, and Switek consistently only refers to "Brontosaurus" with scare quotes.  However, Switek's treatment is compromised by two things.  <img src="images/dino-1.gif" align=right>One is that a number of paleontologists, like Robert Bakker and <B>Stephen J. Gould</B>, continued to use the name <I>Brontosaurus</I>, on the principle that <I>usage</I> can overrule temporal priority.  Switek doesn't even discuss this dissent, despite his purported love for <I>Brontosaurus</I>.  What now also compromises Switek is that the rejection of <I>Brontosaurus</I> has been reversed, allowing that <I>Brontosaurus</I> and <I>Apatosaurus</I> are different genera.  See further <a href="#bronto">discussion</a> below and the <a href="#diplo">list</a> of genera.

<P>One of the great features of Bakker's book is his explanation of the evidence for the large sauropod dinosaurs being able to raise up on their hind legs.  As with <I>Brontosaurus</I> at right, it is easy to see the long processes out of the top of the vertebrae [pp.191-192].  The only purpose for such things is muscle attachments.  Their length indicates the leverage that the muscles need to function, and the only reasonable function is to raise up the body.

<P>While the idea of these dinosaurs rearing up has become general knowledge, the evidence for it has not.  This is clear in the movie <I>Jurassic Park</I>, where a <I>Brachiosaurus</I> is shown rearing up.  However, Bakker shows the skeleton of <I>Brachiosaurus</I> also (below), and its vertebrae <I>do not</I> have the same long processes as <I>Brontosaurus</I>.  <I>Brachiosaurus</I> has longer front legs and a relatively longer neck.  It is thus adapted to high feeding <I>without</I> rearing up.  The makers of <I>Jurassic Park</I> missed this, or ignored it.  In the entrance hall of the <a href="http://www.amnh.org/" target="_top">American Museum of Natural History</a>, in New York City, a <I>Barosaurus</I> is displayed rearing up -- with its conspicuous processes.<img src="images/dino-2.gif" align=left>

<P>Meanwhile, other paleontologists simply don't believe that sauropods like this could even raise their heads, much less raise their whole bodies.  One argument seems to be simple disbelief that the circulatory system could handle the low blood pressure that would result from the raised head.  That there isn't a shred of evidence about what such circulatory systems were, and that giraffes have no trouble raising their heads for what are probably similar purposes of feeding (with physiological adaptations for the changes in blood pressure as the head is raised and lowered), doesn't seem to matter.  I have not noticed any suggestions about what the long sauropod neck would have been for, if it was not for high level feeding.  Perhaps sauropods needed to stick their heads in through windows.  Bakker links the predominance of sauropods in the Jurassic with the absence of low level vegetation, while in the Cretaceous, the rise of flowering plants, with their low level leaves, resulted in the decline of sauropods and the predominance of other herbivores who were adapted for low level feeding.

<P>The idea that evolution represents <I>progress</I> is criticized by some scientists, like Stephen J. Gould himself.  Gould thinks that "natural selection" contains so many accidental features that we can rarely say that its products are "better" than they might have been with some different outcome.  <img src="images/darwin.jpg" align=right>There is no telling what kind of intelligent dinosaurs we might have now if they had not been knocked out by an asteroid 65 million years ago.  Who are we to think that we are "better" than they might have been?  Or, who are we to think that we are better than squids, trilobites, or horseshoe crabs?

<P>The problem with Gould's point of view is that it rejects any possibility that some things are <I>more organized</I> than others.  Yet life itself is more organized than inorganic nature.  Life can occur because the situation of the Earth allows <a href="order.htm" target="_top">entropy</a> to decrease rather than increase, increasing order rather than disorder, an unusual situation in the universe (and used by <a href="creation.htm" target="_top">Creationists</a> to deny that evolution is possible).  But if the Earth allows order to increase over time, then it is reasonable to say that, barring accidents like the asteroid impacts, life <I>will</I> get more and more organized over time.  If dinosaurs had lived, maybe there would be intelligent dinosaurs by now.  But squids and horseshoe crabs <I>have</I> lived, quite content and unchanged in their own ancient ecological niches.  Other forms of life, however, caught by ecological changes or radiating into new niches, have changed dramatically.  With humans, lower entropy not only has occurred with human evolution, but humans now extensively organize Nature around them.  We intentionally lower entropy through vast artificial constructions, in comparison to which the earlier artifacts of living things, like beaver dams, look like, well, mole hills.  The system of life thus does represent, perhaps to the horror of someone like Stephen J. Gould, a <B>hierarchy</B>.  <a href="#human">Human beings</a> indeed look like, as Pericles said, the "paragon of animals."

<P><a name="bronto">On the other hand, Gould sometimes displays towering good sense.  His essay, "Bully for Brontosaurus" [<I>Bully for Brontosaurus, Reflections in Natural History</I>, 1991, W. W. Norton & Company, 1992], addresses the question of whether the genus <I>Brontosaurus</I> should be, or should have been, identified with and renamed <I>Apatosaurus</I>.  Both genera had been named by O. C. Marsh, so there was no question of shifting credit for the discoveries.  As early as 1903, Elmer Riggs, at the Field Museum of Natural History, argued that the identified <I>Apatosaurus</I> was simply a juvenile <I>Brontosaurus</I>.  The <a href="http://www.amnh.org/explore/news-blogs/on-exhibit-posts/a-dinosaur-by-any-other-name" target="_top">American Museum of Natural History</a>, which exhibits a fine <I>Brontosaurus</I> specimen, asserts that the name was "officially changed" because of Riggs' argument, since the naming of <I>Apatosaurus</I> had priority by a couple of years, although certain "writers" continue to use <I>Brontosaurus</I>.

<P>Since I never heard of <I>Apatosaurus</I> until the 1990's, when suddenly authorities were saying that the name that had been used for decades, <I>Brontosaurus</I>, was <I>wrong</I>, this was more than a little perplexing.  And since one of the "writers" who continued to argue for <I>Brontosaurus</I> was no less than Stephen Jay Gould, who not only was professionally associated with the American Museum but, after Margaret Meade, was probably the most famous person to <I>be</I> so associated, one would think that the more common name should be given a bit more respect.  Indeed, Gould's own argument is that one of the criteria for scientific naming is <I>usage</I>.  Since <I>Brontosaurus</I> was the name in common usage of decades, and most people have never heard of <I>Apatosaurus</I>, that should have settled the matter.  That it didn't raises the question why the "authorities" should suddenly have decided to switch things around on everyone.  My suspicion that it is an example of one of the <a href="bureau.htm" target="_top">practical rules of bureaucracy</a>, which is "jerk people around."  As noted above, since it now (2015) seems to be the case that <I>Brontosaurus</I> and <I>Apatosaurus</I> actually are different genera, this particular debate seems moot.

<P>Nevertheless, we do see real progress in Paleontology.  Gould himself relates his awe and fear in seeing the <I>Tyrannosaurus rex</I> at the American Museum when he was a child.  But the <I>Tyrannosaurus rex</I> skeleton at the time was mounted in a clumsy upright stance, leaning back on its tail.  This made it seem like the animal would move by waddling along, like a duck, dragging its tail.  This was consistent with the general picture of dinosaurs at the time, as slow, stupid, and clumsy.

<P><img src="images/T-rex02.jpg" align=right width=600>In the 90's, however, the Museum remounted the <I>Tyrannosaurus</I>, as we see at right, on January 23, 2019, in a way reflecting new ideas about dinosaur physiology and posture (and paid for, doubtlessly to the fury of the political <a href="rand.htm#modern" target="_top">Left</a>, by libertarian and New York resident David Koch, whose name is on the Hall of Saurischian Dinosaurs -- and now on the plaza before the Metropolitan Museum of Art).  Thus, with the spine horizontal and the tail elevated, the <I>Tyrannosaurus</I> is probably considerably more terrifying, with its jaws at eye level, than in the older version.  There are still paleontologists who think of dinosaurs as slow, and of <I>Tyrannosaurus</I> as only a scavenger, but the visual impression of this creature is very different.  "You better be running," is more what we would think, in the immortal words of <a href="ross/karen.htm" target="_top">Selma Blair</a> (a firestarter, <img src="images/greek/the-fem.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/firestar.gif" align=middle>, genitive <img src="images/greek/firestag.gif" align=middle>; or perhaps <img src="images/greek/the-fem.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/firestaf.gif" align=middle>, see <a href="hist-1.htm#note-alex" target="_top">here</a>) from <I>Hellboy</I> [2004].

<P>This is one of the few skeletons of <I>T. rex</I> that has been mounted using the original bones.  Displays like this now typically use casts of the original bones, especially when the excavated skeletons are incomplete, as usually is the case with <I>T. Rex</I>, few of whose complete skeletons survive.  The use of casts, however, may have substantilly begun with Andrew Carnegie, who distributed casts to many museums of <I>Diplodocus carnegii</I> [1901], which had been named after him, since the discoverer, Jacob Wortman, worked for the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburg.  This is a nice example of Gilded Age philanthropy, which both benefited the public and advertised the magnanimity of Andrew Carnegie, who otherwise gets rememebered for the Homestead steel workers strike (1892).  He also donated a <I>lake</I> to Princeton University (1906) -- Lake Carnegie, of course.  The President of the University at the time, <a href="presiden.htm#28" target="_top">Woodrow Wilson</a>, who would bring Southern Segregation to the Federal Government as President of the United States, and whose ideal of government was rule by irresponsible <a href="bureau.htm" target="_top">bureaucrats</a>, told Carnegie, "We needed bread and you gave us cake."

<P>The variety of life here is one of the basic pieces of evidence for Evolution, since the development of one form of life out of another is a simpler explanation (observing "<a href="hist-1.htm#high" target="_top">Ockham's Razor</a>") than having the Creator engage in constant supernatural intervention in order to start off each species (including thousands of beetles) at its ordained time and place.  Such a piecemeal job of Creation would have offended the sense of earlier theologians that God would act with simplicity, economy, and elegance -- which we still find Einstein expecting of the laws of nature as conceived by God.  Advocates of <a href="creation.htm" target="_top">Creationism</a> and <a href="design.htm" target="_top">Intelligent Design</a> expend far less <a href="proof.htm" target="_top">criticism</a> on their own theology than they do on Darwinism.  The idea that <a href="god.htm" target="_top">God</a> would not have anticipated and created all of history, coiled like a spring, right from the very beginning, ready to unfold on its own, would have offended philosophers like both <a href="spinoza.htm" target="_top">Spinoza</a> and <a href="leibniz.htm" target="_top">Leibniz</a>, who otherwise would not have agreed on much.

<P>The following table is preformatted for a fixed, non-proportional type font (like Courier).  This preserves the pattern of the classification and its correspondence to the levels of classification given in the window at the top of the webpage.  If desired, that window can be eliminated by moving the boundary line.  If the font for the tables that appears on your page is not fixed width (non-proportional), the font should be changed by using the "preferences" menu on your browser.  On a computer screen more than 640 pixels wide, the width of the windows can be optimized to include the whole width of the table.  Any category followed by an asterisk, "*," by the way, is extinct.

<P>The classification of Bacteria in Mr. Friend's book didn't match up very well with that in my older sources, like Margulis and Schwartz.  A correspondent pointed out that the Phylum Proteobacteria did not even occur in the table.  Thus, I have now included the Phyla for all Bacteria and subdivisions of the Proteobacteria as they are listed at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria" target="_top">Wikipedia</a>.  I have made some effort to match these up with the higher levels of classification already shown, but I don't know enough details to do this very effectively.  I've also added the Wikipedia list of Phyla of Archaea (Archaebacteria), which do not correspond to the older names I had.  So I end up with a bit of a hash of older and newer nomenclature.  The future of classification is certainly to use mathematical formulae for differences in genetic content.  There are genes for basic chemical activities in the cell that are basically shared by all living things.  Beyond that we get degrees of difference.<br clear=right>

<P>Unfortunately, Friend is a politically correct jounalist who insists on marring his book with nasty environmentalist remarks, like the need to "save the human race from its recklessness and horribly inefficient ways of using energy" [p.28], as though our determination to live our lives with available technology, however inefficient this will appear in the future, is "recklessness" just because we are doing it.  Friend, of course, is free to offer his own technology, which hopefully will not be <I>less</I> efficient, as "alternative fuels" currently are.  Friend's moral indignation over other people, or reality, not measuring up to his expectations is characteristic of the political <a href="rand.htm#modern" target="_top">left</a> and <a href="crichton.htm" target="_top">much</a> of the environmental movement.  On the other hand, Friend seems to be daring and politically <I>incorrect</I> in his appreciation of genetic engineering and biotechnology -- he deserves some credit for this.

<P><B>Architeuthis</B>, the <B>Giant Squid</B>, was until recently ranked as the largest invertebrate.  It has been one of the greatest mysteries in nature, since for decades no mature animal had ever been filmed or photographed alive.  It was sometimes said that one had never been <I>seen</I> alive, but there were several reports of sightings.  Whether they were to be believed was the question, though there is no particular reason why such a report, in general, should not have been believed.  Most of the reports were of sightings at night, and it now well known that many deep sea creatures come up from the depths in the dark.

<br><center><img src="images/squid.gif"></center>

<br><img src="images/oceanic.gif" align=right>Architeuthis was not like Big Foot.  Remains of adult animals were found washed ashore from Britain to New Zealand, and other individuals were found in the stomachs of Sperm Whales.  Intact adults have been found up to 60 feet long -- although now this is said to be an exaggeration (tentacles have been unnaturally stretched before measurement).  The actual bodies (the "mantle") are less than third of that:  &nbsp;It is the arms and tentacles that account for the rest of the length.  The two tentacles are the longest organs, used for actually snaching prey and carrying it to the mouth.  Architeuthis has the largest eyes of any animal.  This is consistent with its deep water habits.  The squids may frequent depths of 2000 feet or more, where light from above no longer exists, but many animals generate their own light, for various reasons.  Sightings of live Architeuthis at the surface have only been at night.  The large eyes may also be why living individuals were not been seen at depth.  Human deep sea vehicles are usually lit up like Christmas trees, with searchlights and television cameras scanning the area.  This is going to be conspicuous, if not positively painful, to Architeuthis, which, if healthy, will be able to avoid being anywhere near would-be observers.  Indeed, a large portion of the known species of any kind of squid have not been observed alive.  They live in all oceans from top to bottom.  Squids are basically <B><I>pelagic</I></B>, i.e. live in open water, unlike octopuses, which are <B><I>benthic</I></B>, i.e. tend to live on the ocean bottom -- although there <I>are</I> some pelagic octopi and benthic squid.  Neither kind of animal has air sacs or voids in its body (although the closely related cuttlefish do).  This enables them to easily adapt to any depth or pressure in the ocean.  Sperm Whales can dive to great depths to eat Giant Squids, but as their lungs collapse, there are limits.  <img src="images/giantsqd.jpg" align=left>The squids do fight back, since such whales often have scars that look like the work of Architeuthis.  There are naturalists who have been specifically looking for Giant Squids, and hopefully they will continue to think of strategies or camouflage to overcome how or why it is that the animals tend to avoid observation.

<P>In September 2005, news broke that Japanese scientists had finally observed a live Giant Squid at depth.  They had done this back in September 2004, and I still have not seen the reason why the the news was so delayed.  They took more than 500 pictures of one 25 foot long individual they found at 2,950 feet (900 meters) beneath the North Pacific Ocean.  Unfortunately, they were able to do this by hooking the animal, and in its struggle to get away, it lost one of its tentacles, which was recovered by the Japanese.  This sighting still doesn't seem to involve movies of direct observation from submersibles.

<P>I have been waiting for the shows on the <a href="http://dsc.discovery.com/" target="_top">Discovery</a>, <a href="http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/" target="_top">National Geographic</a>, or the (Discovery) Science Channels about all this, and now I have seen a good hour long show on the <a href="http://science.discovery.com/" target="_top">Science Channel</a> about the achievement, called "Giant Squid: Caught on Camera."  The Japanese scientists found the squid by following the sperm whales who hunt them off Japan.  The whales are certainly as impressive as the Giant Squid, diving down more than a mile and staying down for a couple of hours.  The undigested beaks of multiple squid are often found in the stomachs of the whales, and their hide is scarred from squid suckers.  Tracking devices were placed on the whales to see how deep they were diving to hunt the squid, and that is where the pictures were caught.

<P>There is now another issue involved here.  Since 2003, complete specimens have been described of the <B>Colossal Squid</B> (<I>Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni</I>, 1925).  The Colossal Squid is shorter but heavier than <I>Architeuthis</I> and has been receiving considerable, if not the lion's share, of media attention the last few years, since this now counts as the largest invertebrate.  The largest Colossal Squid, caught in 2007, weighed in at 1091 lbs. and was 33 ft. long.  While the range of the Giant Squid is through all the worlds oceans, the Colossal Squid appears to be confined to the circumantarctic Southern Ocean.  How recent is the recognition of the Colossal Squid, which was originally described (in 1925) only from fragments, I can tell from my previous sourcebook on Celphalopods:  &nbsp;<I>Cephalopods, A World Guide</I>, by Mark Norman [ConchBooks, Hackenheim, Germany, 2000].  This handsome volume, which I bought in 2002, contains no mention whatsoever of the Colossal Squid or <I>Mesonychoteuthis</I>.  The introduction to the <I>Architeuthidae</I> simply says, "Giant Squids are the largest of all the cephalopods and the largest individual intervertebrate in the world" [p.150].  This now needs to be rewritten.<br clear=left>

<H3 align=center>All Living Things, in Seven Kingdoms, Note 4;<br>The Coelacanth</H3>

<p><center><img src="images/key-9.gif"></center>

<P><img src="images/latimer.jpg" width=300 align=left>Until 1938, specimens of lobe-finned fishes of the Order Crossopterygii, the ancestors of amphibians, were only known from fossils.  They appeared to have died out in the Cretaceous.

<P>Then a fisherman from East London, South Africa, brought in a fish he did not recognize.  He called Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer, curator of the museum in East London, to have a look at it.  She could not identify the fish and called her friend, ichthyologist James Leonard Brierley Smith.  After some delay, in which the fish needed to be sent to a taxidermist, Smith examined the specimen and recognized that it was a Coelacanth.  The genus was named <I>Latimeria</I> after Marjorie.  Since the fish had been damaged by the taxidermy, some questions remained until more examples were caught in 1952.  Living fish were filmed under water only in 1988.

<P>Up to six feet long and bright blue in life, but evidently not good eating (they had long been known to the locals), these dramatic fish, with their dramatic identification, gave a whole new meaning to the term "living fossil."  Smith said that he could not have been more surprised if he had seen a dinosaur walking down the street.

<H3 align=center>All Living Things, in Seven Kingdoms, Note 5;<br>Ratites</H3>

<p><center><img src="images/key-9.gif"></center>

<P><img src="images/ratites.gif" align=right>The <B>Ratites</B> are a group of birds that include the largest birds.  Ostriches can stand nine feet tall, but Moas and Elephant Birds were taller.  The Ratites are now all flightness, except for the Tinamous.  Ideas about the Ratites have recently been badly shaken by DNA studies.  We also have some uncertainty about the generality of the group, with classifications grouping them as either a Superorder or an Infraclass.

<P>The diagram at right reflects the list given above.  This has been altered from the classication previously on this page, where the Superorder Palaeognathae simply contained seven Orders of birds, the Struthioniformes (Ostriches), Rheiformes (Rheas), Dinornithiformes (Moas), Tinamiformes (Tinamous), Casuariiformes (Cassowaries and Emus), Aepyrornithiformes (Elephant Birds), and Apterygiformes (Kiwis).  The equality of the Orders embodied uncertainty about the genetic relations of the groups, something not unusual with birds, whose fossils have been rare.

<P>Previously, since all Ratites are confinded to the Southern Hemisphere, it was concluded that they originated on the great southern continent of Gondwanaland, during the Creataceous.  Gondwanaland then broke up, isolating populations in South America, Africa, and Australia, and on islands like New Zeland and Madagascar.<br clear=right>

<P><img src="images/ostrich.gif" align=right><img src="images/ratites1.gif" align=left>Since the South American Timanou can fly, and all of the other birds cannot, with the same reduction of the breast bone, which no longer anchors flight muscles, the inference was that a common ancestor lost flight, with the Tinamou preserving the ancestral power.  So the Tinamou wasn't even a true Ratite.

<P>The diagram at left displays the judgment about all this as of 1974.  The birds are grouped by location, with the exception of the Tinamous, which share South America with Rheas.  Thus, the flying branch of ancestry was only preserved in South America, while the Rheas are the South American branch of the lineage in Gondwanaland that lost flight, and is otherwise found on all the daughter continents.  The Elephant Birds of Madagascar are not shown here, but we are free to infer a close relationship with Ostriches, which have been found both in Africa and, with fossils, in India, either of which could have shared species with Madagascar.<br clear=left>

<P>This logical and almost self-evident arrangement was completely scrambled when DNA studies were done on the living species and on the available DNA of the fossils of extinct ones.  The lineage that certainly had to be distinct from all the others, of the flying Tinamous, is now buried deep in the phylogeny, <img src="images/ratites2.gif" align=right>closely related to the Moas in New Zealand, which is almost literally a world away from South America.  Just as bad, or worse, is that the extinct Elephant Birds of Madagascar are the most closely related to the tiny and peculiar Kiwis of New Zealand, a full ocean, and more, if not exectly a world, away from each other.

<P>These results are challenging in several ways.  How would a common ancestor have descendants in just New Zealand and South America, and another have descendants in just New Zealand and Madagascar?  This adds to the strangeness of Madagascar, which is the home of all surviving <a href="#prosimians">Prosimians</a>, and whose human languages are related to the <a href="hawaii.htm#languages" target="_top">Polynesian</a> M&acirc;ori language of New Zealand.  The timeline seems to prevent these sharings from dating to when the land masses were adjacent in the Cretaceous.  We end up with the picture of Kiwis somehow flying to New Zealand from Madagascar.  And it would be a very long way for Tinamous to fly from New Zealand to South America, without leaving descendants behind.  Or anywhere else along the way.

<P>Even worse, if it is considered impossible that Tinamous could have returned to flight from a flightless ancestor, this means that the ancestor of nearly every lineage of Ratites could fly and that each lineage thus <I>independently</I> became flightless.  This is very hard to credit, especially if the reduction in the breast bone is apparently identical in all of them.  Evolution doesn't work that way.

<P>So we have multiple mysteries with the Ratites -- problems that until recently didn't even exist.  But it means great fun to figure this out.  Genuine scientists love it when conventional wisdom is suddenly overthrown, with no obvious path forward.  If only there were more scientists like that in <a href="crichton.htm" target="_top">climatology</a>.
