# Welcome
We Will Try to keep things as [Simple](https://soundcloud.com/odicforcesounds_signals_of_time/gift-simplicity) as Possible

## Slogan
If Time is built within Our Self's, then Time is Our Self's, as result of Time it Self

## What this application challenge don't want to be?
- Is Not a Social-Media (users cannot search for others)
- Users cannot add friends 
- No Comments? (comments are <b>useful</b> for those who make actions as description and for those who deny (to know <b>why</b>))
- No Chat 

## What this application challenge aims to be?
- More than anything, this challenge is a [out-of-the-box](https://wiki.odicforcesounds.com/docs/en/Tao/Fragments/OdicPoints/) action challenge.
- Read more Questions about this challenge development [here](https://wiki.odicforcesounds.com/docs/plan/Questions.html)

- All Private Brands of the World

## Rules:

## Main Discussion: Coding - 2020 
[Dive into the World of JavaScript](https://odicforcesounds.bandcamp.com/track/dive-into-the-world-of-javascript)
- The Best Free Testing proposes Project to handle databases is [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
- You already have experience with JavaScript.
- We have different options, all of them good. 
1. We write in **JavaScript**
2. We write in **[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**
3. We use a Framework like **[VueJS](https://vuejs.org/)** or **[Angular](https://angular.io/)** where both can use **ES6** or **TypeScript**
4. Since we wish to target all devices, some extra frameworks can he handle, as Ionic. 
5. While **[Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/)** framework and many others can produce content for **Android** and **iOS**, we may care to develop a specific platform application using Java. 
6. For each Social Media, if user is logged by **[Google](https://accounts.google.com/Login)** accounts or **[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/login/device-based/regular/login/?login_attempt=1&)** accounts, users need to login using [Android](https://www.android.com/) or [iOS](https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-13/). ( We start testing using only a Webapp for PC browser (e.g. [Google Chromium](https://www.google.com/chrome/) ) 
7. Care! Firebase works with NoSQL and NodeJS. Naturally we write both: front end and backend JavaScript Applications

- Thinking this Application, as a functional application, we don't need a Awesome Interface for users, but if all principles of this application grow, we should care to put things beautiful and nice. 

## The functional condition of players is always the same: 
1. Do Action: (when action is done, user jump to rate actions(videos))
2. Rate Actions (each use need to rate (lets say: 7 videos, then user can do another action)

## Player [Menus](https://wiki.odicforcesounds.com/docs/en/Tao/Fragments/UserInterface/)
1. <button>Do Action</button> 
2. <button>Rate Action</button>
3. [ShortPathName](https://wiki.odicforcesounds.com/docs/en/Tao/Fragments/Path/) e.g. NCP (Nature Care Path) : Value e.g. [0] - Result: **NPC** [0000] 
4. Rating Menu (activated in the end of video) 
- <button>0</button> (deny) 
- <button>1</button> (approve)

## Users Proprieties
Note: If this application grows... 
- Users Psychological Characteristics Rate (inside companies promotions (commercial relation))
- Professional Users Characteristics State
- Users Personal Characteristics ( hobbies and health )
- Users Actions Challenge Rate / Status. (number of actions per Path) 

## Sensible Data and Storing 
1. [Company_name](https://wiki.odicforcesounds.com/docs/en/Tao/Fragments/BrandsInterface/).
2. Number of Employees
3. Employee Email
4. Points / Coins
5. Users Action Device GPS Points Coords (animation propose)

## Not Sensible Data - Temporary Storing
1. Online Video Stream Link made by User. Lets focus on **Youtube API** 

## Services
- When an action is approved, user gain 1 point and company gain 1 point too. 
- User points can be used as coins.
- Company points cannot be used as coins.
- Public Status: list of registered companies names with points association. 

## Video Services
- Users produce action concept proof by streaming a video that is stored in some service like **Youtube**. We only need to know that address of the video user made, to share that video adress as a video to rate, to X users more until rate get 7 positive or negative votes. So, again: if we can know that link, we don't need to store videos ;) 
- Note: Since I only know / read about JavaScript world, I do a relation between using Redux to control User Video Time state.  

## This is a test or maybe this is a challenge
As any contribution is as well, numeric expressions that represent value, money, for each contribution that pass throught all reviews in a pull request, we share a numeric expression that represents value (N) 

- Lets think as simple as (1). 

If this 1 was a dolar is 1 dolar, if this 1 is a euro, is 1 euro, while if is 1 bitcoin is a lot more. So what is the values of this competition actions? Each person is free to associate a single numeric expression that represents value, to the desire value that those actions can represent. 

## Dreams: 
- I wish Bitcoin industry accept that 1 single numeric expression that represents values from this challenge, could be 1 **Bitcoin**.
