To one another! for the world, which seems<br>
To lie before us like a land of dreams,<br>
So various, so beautiful, so new,<br>
Hath really neither joy, nor love, nor light,<br>
Nor certitude, nor peace, nor help for pain;<br>
And we are here as on a darkling plain<br>
Swept with confused alarms of struggle and flight,<br>
Where ignorant armies clash by night.</font></blockquote>

<P><B>Siddh&acirc;rtha Gautama</B>, <img src="images/greek/siddhart.gif" align=middle><img src="images/greek/gautama.gif" align=middle> (563-483 or 466-386 BC), also called <B>Sh&acirc;kyamuni</B>, <img src="images/greek/shakya.gif" align=middle><img src="images/greek/muni.gif" align=middle> (the Sage of the Shakya Clan), the <B>Gautama Buddha</B>, <img src="images/greek/gautama.gif" align=middle><img src="images/greek/buddha.gif" align=middle>, the "Enlightened One" (from <I>budh</I>, "to wake up"), and the <B>Tath&acirc;gata</B>, <img src="images/greek/tathagad.gif" align=middle> (the "Thus Come"), was born to a royal <a href="caste.htm">Ks.atriya</a> family.

<P>At his birth there was a prophecy that either he would become a world conqueror, a <I>Cakravartin</I>, <a href="sangoku.htm#india"><img src="images/greek/cakravar.gif" align=middle border=0></a>, or he would "conquer" the <a href="sangoku.htm#cakra">world</a> by renouncing it and becoming a Buddha.  His father preferred the more tangible kind of conquest and tried to shield Siddhartha from all the evils of life that might tempt him into spiritual reflection.  This strategy backfired; for when, about age thirty, Siddhartha finally did experience evils, by encountering a sick man, an old man, a dead man, and a wandering ascetic, he determined immediately to renounce the world and seek enlightenment like the ascetic.  This violated Siddhartha's duty as a householder, since his wife had just given birth to their first child, but Vedic duties and the traditional <a href="caste.htm">four stages of life</a> were no longer of interest to him.

<P><a name="dharma">After years of fasting and other ascetic</a> practices, during which he supposedly subsisted on as little as one grain of rice a day, Siddhartha felt that he had achieved nothing.  He ceased his fasting, which disillusioned his fellow ascetics -- "Siddhartha has become luxuriant!"  They left him.  Siddhartha then sat down under a tree with the determination not to arise until he had achieved enlightenment -- which sounds like an ascetic practice in its own right.  The tree became the <B>Bodhi</B>, <img src="images/greek/bodhi.gif" align=middle>, "Enlightenment," Tree; for under it Siddhartha, resisting the attacks and temptations of M&acirc;ra, the king of the demons, became the <B>Buddha</B>, <img src="images/greek/buddha.gif" align=middle>, the one who "Woke Up."

<P>In the traditional chronology, that was in about 527. <img src="images/chakra.gif" align=right>The Buddha proceeded to S&acirc;rn&acirc;th, near Benares [<a href="#note-2">note</a>].  Along the way he met some traveling merchants, who recognized him as a Buddha.  Since merchants <a href="#maha">later</a> spread Buddhism to Central Asia and China, this began a tradition of respect for merchants and trade, very different from the disapproving attitude in <a href="trade.htm">Western</a> philosophy or in <a href="confuci.htm#note-3">Confucianism</a>.  At S&acirc;rn&acirc;th, the Buddha encountered his old companions and delivered his first sermon in a place called the Deer Park.  That set the "Wheel of the Law," the <I><B>Dharmacakra</B></I>, <img src="images/greek/dharmcak.gif" align=middle>, in motion.

<P>The form of the <I>Dharmacakra</I> at right is identical to the one on the flag of India and is copied from a pillar set up at S&acirc;rn&acirc;th by the great King <a href="sangoku.htm#mauryas">Ashoka</a>.  In Chinese, the "Wheel of the Law" is translated <img src="images/hiero/sch-leg.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/wheel.gif" align=middle> (<I>H&ocirc;rin</I> in Japanese), and to "revolve" the Wheel, or preach the Dharma, is <img src="images/hiero/revolve.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/sch-leg.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/wheel.gif" align=middle> (<I>Tenh&ocirc;rin</I> in Japanese).

<P>The Buddha's sermon consisted of the Four Noble Truths, <img src="images/greek/arya.gif" align=middle><img src="images/greek/satya.gif" align=middle>, <I>&Acirc;ryastya</I>:<br clear=right>

<ol>
<li> <a name="1suffer">The Truth of Suffering, or Misery (<I>Duhkhasatya</I>, <img src="images/greek/duhkha.gif" align=middle><img src="images/greek/satya.gif" align=middle>), that life is suffering, including birth, disease, old age, and death;

<P><blockquote>I have seen people saying that the First Noble Truth is not really "suffering" or "misery," which are "mistranslations," but something more like unhappiness, dislocation, dissatisfaction, or "unsatisfactoriness," on the analogy that <img src="images/greek/duhkha.gif" align=middle>, <I>duhkha</I>, is about a chariot axle not working quite right.  I see some texts (which I had even used for my <a href="./valley/30-s09.htm">classes</a>) claiming that this is the "deeper meaning" of <I>duhkha</I>.  I have also heard that religious practices, like meditation in Buddhism, are simply a way of releaving "stress," which will make us healthier and happier in life.  The Buddha is even said to have discovered that Salvation, or <I>Nirv&acirc;n.a</I>, <img src="images/greek/nirvana.gif" align=middle> ("Extinction"), is nevertheless simply living "normal human life... doing normal human things" -- something that the Buddha himself, of course, unaccountably did not do.

<P>This whole business seems to go back to what is presented as the etymology of <I>duhkha</I>.  <I>Sukha</I>, <img src="images/greek/sukha.gif" align=middle>, can mean "pleasant, agreeable, gentle, mild, comfortable, happy, prosperous" [M.F. Monier-Williams, <I>Sanskr.it-English Dictionary</I>, Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers, New Delhi, 2008, p.1220, Oxford, 1899].  This analyzes as "good," <I>su</I>, <img src="images/greek/su.gif" align=middle> [cognate to Greek <img src="images/greek/eu.gif" align=middle>, "well, good"], "[axle] hole," <I>kha</I>, <img src="images/greek/kha.gif" align=middle> ["cavity, hollow, aperture... 'the hole in the nave of a wheel through which the axle runs'," p.334], giving, with the other meanings, "having a good axle-hole."  The opposite of this would be <I>duhkha,</I> <img src="images/greek/duhkha.gif" align=middle>, i.e. "bad [axle] hole."  Therefore it is said that <I>duhkha</I> does not really mean anything all that bad.  The "YogaGlo" site (which I mention, not because it is important or authoritative in itself, but just because it is characteristic) says that <I>duhkha</I> "might be thought more simply as a 'bad fit'," or "uneasiness, or discomfort."  The problems with this I would classify under three headings:

<P><ol>
<li>I have never seen the citation of a canonical, authoritative text where the Buddha says something like, "Now don't get the wrong idea about this.  I just mean that <I>duhkha</I> makes us uneasy.  I may be a wandering ascetic; but I don't expect all you to do something so extreme and abnormal, the way I have.  I mean, what kind of socially conscious person goes around begging?  The government owes them a job, you know, and medical care.  Social justice means that the police should be <I>taking</I> the money from those who have it -- like my father -- and giving it to me, oh, I mean, to the poor.  And this celibacy stuff, I mean, that's for people like child molesting Catholic priests, not for, er, ah, me?  I'm going to have to think about that."  

<P>The <I>Tripitaka</I> is huge, and I can't say I've read much of it at all; but Buddhist scholars I know have read a lot, and they know of no proof text for this.  More authoritative persons making this argument, whether Zen masters or lamas, don't seem to have a reference to Scripture ready.  Instead,

<P><li>The canonical examples of <I>duhkha</I> are inconsistent with its trivialization (which is what we are talking about).  A canonical statement is at Majjhima-Nikâya, Sutta 63, where the Buddha says "there still remain birth, old age, death, sorrow, lamentation, misery, grief, and despair, for the extinction of which in the present life I am prescribing" [Henry Clarke Warren, <I>Buddhism in Translation</I>, Cosimo, 2005, p.121, Atheneum, 1896].   When Siddhartha went out, he saw an old man, a sick man, a dead man, and an ascetic.  He did not see someone just having a bad (hair) day.  I would say that disease, death, "sorrow, lamentation... grief, and despair," amount to a lot more than "uneasiness."  Anyone regarding a malfunctioning axle as "deeper" than the experience of disease, old age, or death sounds like they have not had much experience of disease, old age, death, grief, despair, or lamentation.  Indeed, grief, despair, and lamentation are not manifestations of anything so tepid as "dissatisfaction."  Furthermore, the sort of modernist, feel-good, psychologized version of Buddhism that something like "YogaGlo" promotes is not going to involve the practices posited by the Buddha, namely asceticism and monasticism.  But then, that is probably the point.  The modernist guru is world-affirming and has no intention of recommending renunciation to his audience.  We all know that celibacy is unhealthy.  Ask any Zen master -- although most historical Zen masters were celibate monks.

<P><li>While the etymology for <I>duhkha</I> is cute, it is a fundamental linguistic and semantic error to reduce the meaning of a word to its etymology -- especially when that may be a speculative or folk etymology.  Indeed, the Monier-Williams <I>Sanskr.t-English Dictionary</I> says that <I>duhkha</I> is "more probably a Prakritized form for duh-stha" [p.483], in which the second element, <I>sth&acirc;</I>, <img src="images/greek/stha.gif" align=middle>, is simply the cognate of "stand" in English (or <I>st&ecirc;-</I> in Greek <img src="images/greek/histemi.gif" align=middle>, "make to stand, stand").  No axle holes here.  The question then is about the first element, <I>duh</I>, <img src="images/greek/duh.gif" align=middle> in the compound:<p>

<ol>
<li>This can be from <I>du</I>, <img src="images/greek/du.gif" align=middle>, which Monier-Williams defines as "to be burnt; to burn, cause internal heat, pain, or sorrow, afflict, distress" [p.483].  We also get "burn, be pained; pain, hardship, misery, suffering" [in <I>A Practical Sanskrit Dictionary</I>, Arthur Anthony Macdonell, Oxford University Press, 1929, 1971, p. 121].<p>

<li>Or it can be from <I>dush</I>, <img src="images/greek/dush.gif" align=middle>, "wrong, bad," which can be reduced to <I>duh</I>, <img src="images/greek/duh.gif" align=middle>.  <I>Dush</I> in Monier-Williams is "to become bad or corrupted, to be defiled or impure, to be ruined, perish; to sin, commit a fault, be wrong" [p.488].
</ol>

<P>Either way, <I>duh</I> is going to be a rather stronger element than the YogaGlo version of <I>duhkha</I> is going to contemplate.

<P>If <I>Nirv&acirc;n.a</I> is living a "normal human life... doing normal human things" -- as one of my textbooks actually said -- then not only is the practice of the Buddha himself inexplicable, but what we hear about his followers is also something very different.  When asked why he had abandoned Vedic sacrifices and become a follower of the Buddha, the Brahmin Kassapa answered:

<P><blockquote>It is visible things and sounds, and also tastes, pleasures and woman that the sacrifices speak of; because I understood that <B>whatever belongs to existence is filth</B>, therefore I took no more delight in sacrifices and offerings. [Vinaya 1,36, quoted by Patrick Olivelle, <I>The &Acirc;s´rama System</I>, Oxford, 1993, boldface added]</blockquote>

<P>Somehow, if "whatever belongs to existence is filth," including pleasures and women, it is hard to imagine Kassapa leaving his Buddhist meditation class to drive his SUV home to a suburban household and prosperous professional life.  Siddhartha walked away (well, rode way, actually) from all that.  To the idea that the Buddha's Enlightenment meant that he could just live a "normal life," the critical question would be to ask, "Well, why didn't the Buddha then just <I>go home</I> and return to his wife and family?"  But the Buddha obviously did not live a "normal" life "doing normal human things."  He was a mendicant monk, and still an ascetic; and one may notice that Westerners, who may rather smugly tell us that <I>Nirv&acirc;n.a</I> is just "normal life," are almost never engaging in monastic practice themselves.  Its very existence renders their assertions incoherent.  So they conveniently forget about it.

<P>My suspicion is that those who trivialize the meaning of "suffering" may be transposing, consciously or unconsciously, a <a href="#maha">Mah&acirc;y&acirc;na</a> notion that maybe the world isn't all that bad.  This is a point of view that is, to be sure, part of the Buddhist tradition, but it is very different from the early message and attitude of Buddhism.  Nor is it even characteristic of all of the Mah&acirc;y&acirc;na, where the practice of <a href="six.htm#jodo">Pure Land</a> schools is to "shun the defiled world."  Also, the most authoritative Sutra, the <I>Lotus Sutra</I>, for the <a href="six.htm#tendai">Tendai</a> and <a href="six.htm#nichiren">Nichiren</a> sects, which are themselves noteworthy for their reconciliation with the mundane world, nevertheless contains the striking characterization of the world as a "burning house."  A "burning house" offers little opportunity for a trivializing interpretation of suffering, and it recalls part of the likely meaning of <I>dukhha</I>, <img src="images/greek/duhkha.gif" align=middle>, "to burn."

<P>Acting like Mah&acirc;y&acirc;na doctrine was the meaning of Buddhism from the beginning may reflect a sectarian commitment, but it is ahistorical and, for people who are supposed to be scholars of Buddhism, dishonest or incompetent.  However, the idea that the world is <I>essentially</I> unpleasant, in all its details, and gives us a nagging feeling that <I>something is not quite right</I>, is a good Buddhist <I>clue</I> that something is wrong more deeply.  This is even rather like what we find in the movie, <a href="matrix.htm"><I>The Matrix</I></a>, where, from initial uneasiness, and in properly Buddhist fashion, it turns out that the world is a horrible illusion and deception.

<P><a name="text-1">Much worse than presenting as original and authentic an interpretation of Buddhism that may actually only be characteristic of <I>some</I> schools of the Mah&acirc;y&acirc;na is a secularizing and psychologizing approach.  If Buddhist practice relieves stress and produces greater health and happiness, and enables us to live a normal life, it does not matter that disease, old age, and death are still there if death itself will actually deliver us from these conditions.  We can get his approach from people who are in fact modern <a href="matter.htm">materialists</a> and naturalists, reject the reality of <a href="karma.htm">karma</a> and reincarnation, dismiss the miraculous powers of the Buddha as metaphors or fairy tales, and regard death as nothingness.  Each of these contradicts basic Buddhist metaphysics and are all historically judged to be major Buddhist heresies.  Viewing the dead as nothing is "annihilationism" and conflicts with the application of the Four-Fold Negation to the ontology of <I>Nirv&acirc;n.a</I>.  In Buddhist philosophy, materialism is despised.  It is alien to the letter and the spirit of Buddhism, not to mention rather missing the point.  A lot of "Buddhist modernism" is an attempt to reduce Buddhism to nothing more than a scientifically reasonable form of rationalistic philosophy, while at the same time scrambling to make it ecologically and <a href="rand.htm#modern">politically</a> correct.  These are concerns that are foreign to any traditional form of Buddhism and irrelevant to the sober truth of the Buddha's insights.  Why people who may regard themselves as Buddhists would give doctrinal credence and priority to the metaphysics of Western <a href="atheism.htm">atheists</a> puzzles me [<a href="#note-1">note</a>].</blockquote><p>

<li> <a name="2cause">The Truth of the Cause (<I>Samudayasatya</I>, <img src="images/greek/samudaya.gif" align=middle><img src="images/greek/satya.gif" align=middle>), that suffering is caused by desire (<img src="images/greek/desire1.gif" align=middle>) and by ignorance (<I>avidy&acirc;</I>, <img src="images/greek/avidya.gif" align=middle>), which ultimately depend on each other.  This is the doctrine of Dependent Origination, discussed <a href="#dependent">below</a>.  Despite rigorous attacks on the metaphysics of <a href="#basic">substance and essence</a>, there is no critique of causality in Buddhism as there is in Western Philosophy with <a href="hist-1.htm#islam">al-Ghazz&acirc;l&icirc;</a> or <a href="hume.htm">David Hume</a>;<p>

<li> <a name="3stop">The Truth of Cessation (<I>Nirodhasatya</I>, <img src="images/greek/nirodha.gif" align=middle><img src="images/greek/satya.gif" align=middle>), that suffering can be ended if its causes, desire and ignorance, are removed.  Again, in the Mah&acirc;y&acirc;na, we get the notion that desire can be transformed rather than abolished, which strictly speaking leaves us as part of the cycle of Dependent Origination; and<p>

<li> <a name="4way">The Truth of the Way (<I>M&acirc;rgasatya</I>, <img src="images/greek/marga.gif" align=middle><img src="images/greek/satya.gif" align=middle>), which is the <B>Middle Way</B> between the extremes of asceticism and indulgence.  I might expect the "Middle Way" to be  <img src="images/greek/madhya.gif" align=middle><img src="images/greek/marga.gif" align=middle>, <I>madhyam&acirc;rga</I>; but I do not see use of this particular expression.

<P>The Buddha established a monastic Order, the <img src="images/greek/sangha.gif" align=middle> (Chinese <a href="confuci.htm#note-1"><img src="images/hiero/monk.gif" align=middle border=0><img src="images/hiero/school1.gif" align=middle border=0></a>), with five basic Precepts:  not to kill, not to steal, not to be unchaste, not to drink intoxicants, and not to lie.  The monastic discipline soon involved many more rules, and the Five Precepts became simple moral injunctions that applied to the laity as well as to the monks and nuns -- until debate began about whether the Precepts needed to be observed at all.

<P>For all Buddhists, lay and monastic, convertion to Buddhism involved accepting the "Three Refuges," <img src="images/greek/tri.gif" align=middle><img src="images/greek/refuge.gif" align=middle>, <I>Tri-Sharan.a</I>, i.e. (1) Refuge in the Buddha, (2) Refuge in the Dharma, and (3) Refuge in the Sangha.  Note that this is not really a confession of faith or a creed, except indirectly.  Presumably one must know about the Buddha to take refuge in him, but this is presupposed.  The only institutional aspect to this involved the Sangha, but lay Buddhists may only interact with the Sangha by making offerings to monks.  Later, the institutional presence of Buddhism will involve monasteries, temples, and ritual services, through which monks become "priests," whose presence in the community is more established and permanent than mendicant monks.  Some ritual services we might expect from religion, and certainly from Hinduism, like weddings, were long of little interest to Buddhism.  And in Japan, where weddings are usually handled by Shinto, it is only unusual Buddhist sects that now officiate at them.

<P>Indeed, when Buddhism really only existed as the Sangha, a larger social context was assumed.  This is starkly evident in Japan, where the symbiosis between Buddhism and native relgion -- which came to be called <I>Shint&ocirc;</I>, <img src="images/hiero/kami.gif" align=middle><img src="images/dao2.gif" align=middle>, the "Way of the gods" -- progressed to the point that sometimes it was hard to tell them apart.  An attempt at legal and institutional separation was made in the <a href="sangoku.htm#modern">Meiji Period</a>, but this proved unpopular and unworkable, so that today the saying is "Born Shint&ocirc;, die Buddhist."  Shint&ocirc; will not touch anything having to do with death, while Buddhism is mainly uninterested in birth, marriage, etc.  A further syncreticism can be seen in "Born Shinto, marry Christian, die Buddhist," although the trappings of a Christian wedding are valued mainly for the clothes, and these are sometimes only featured at the wedding banquet, without the necessity of a church service -- where many churches would be reluctant to conduct real weddings for people who are not real Christians.

<P>On the other hand, the Kingdom of <a href="perigoku.htm#korea">Korea</a>, under the influence of <a href="sangoku.htm#ming">Ming</a> Neo-Confucianism, actively suppressed Buddhism for centuries.  Such policies were ended by the Japanese, which unfortunately then associated Buddhism with the Japanese occupation, especially when Japanese Buddhist sects established "missions" in Korea.  The result is that as many or more Koreans now are Christian than Buddhist.

<P>Once Buddhism was (reluctantly) accepted in China, the institutional and ideological systematization of Chinese religion led to the theory of the <a href="confuci.htm#text-1">Three Ways</a>.  Confucianism was never happy with either Buddhism or Taoism, but even staunch Confucians often found themselves unable to avoid Buddhist and Taoist influences.  Indeed, there is no Confucian aesthetics, all of which is derived from Taoism; and the popular gods of China usually appear in Taoist and Buddhist reflexes.

<P>Practice according to the Precepts accumulated moral Merit, and then, with sufficient Merit, Enlightenment would lead one to <I>Nirv&acirc;n.a</I>, <img src="images/greek/nirvana.gif" align=middle>, which the Buddha refused to positively characterize.  Since <I>Nirv&acirc;n.a</I> means "Extinction," do we even exist when we achieve <I>Nirv&acirc;n.a</I>?  The Buddha denied that we exist, denied that we do not exist, denied that we both exist and do not exist, and denied that we neither exist nor do not exist.  This kind of answer is called the Four-Fold Negation and becomes a fundamental Buddhist philosophical principle to deal with attempts to characterize Nirv&acirc;n.a or ultimate reality:  &nbsp;we cannot either affirm or deny anything about them.

<P>Buddhist scriptures are called the <I>Tripit.aka</I>, <img src="images/greek/tripitak.gif" align=middle>, or the "Three Baskets," consisting of the <I>Sutrapit.aka</I>, the Buddha's sermons, the <I>Vinayapit.aka</I>, the monastic rules, and the <I>Abhidharmapit.aka</I>, early philosophical treatises.  The Buddha himself spoke the <a href="cognates.htm#sanskrit">Prakrit</a> M&acirc;gadh&icirc;, but the oldest version of the <I>Tripit.aka</I> that is extant was committed to writing in Sri Lanka using the Prakrit P&acirc;li, which had become a literary language.  These texts are called the "P&acirc;li Canon."  The version of the <I>Tripit.aka</I> that exists in Chinese used to be regarded as derived from the P&acirc;li Canon, but they are now both seen as based on older versions.  One frequently finds P&acirc;li terminology used in reference to Buddhism.  Sanskrit <img src="images/greek/sutra.gif" align=middle>, <I>s&ucirc;tra</I>, becomes <I>sutta</I>; <I>dharma</I> becomes <I>dhamma</I>; <img src="images/greek/rishi.gif" align=middle>, <I>r.s.i</I> (Hindi <I>rishi</I>) becomes <I>isi</I>; <a href="caste.htm"><I>&acirc;shrama</I></a>, <img src="images/greek/ashrama.gif" align=middle>, becomes <I>assama</I>; (King) <a href="sangoku.htm#mauryas"><I>Ashoka</I></a> becomes <I>Asoka</I>; etc.

<P><center><img src="images/key.gif"></center>

<P>As I have noted, it is tempting to many to see the Buddha as essentially a philosopher and Buddhism as profoundly unlike other world religions -- perhaps not a religion at all.  Since there is no God or soul in Buddhism, there is certainly a sharp contrast with religions like Judaism, Christianity, or Isl&acirc;m.  However, the contast is less sharp with other historical and world religions.  Thus, while there is no God, there are <I>gods</I> in Buddhism, gods like Indra and <a href="gods.htm">Brahm&acirc;</a> who turn up as guardians of Buddhist temples.  Most importantly, the sanctity of the Buddha, the "Blessed One," himself is immediately obvious.  After his death, the ashes of the Buddha became <I>relics</I> in much the same way that we find relics of the Saints in Christianity.  The form of the <I>stupa</I> originally served to enshrine such relics.

<P>Indeed, it has become credible that the share of the Buddha's relics, 1/8th, kept by his own Shakya Clan, was actually discovered <I>in situ</I> in 1898 at <a href="sangoku.htm#relics">Piprahwa</a> by the amateur excavator William Peppe.  The jewels and other treasures of the find were kept by the Government of India and the Peppe family, while the actual bones and ashes found were given to the Buddhist King of <a href="perigoku.htm#siam7">Siam</a>.  In Buddhist tradition, however, some of the jewels, if not all, may have counted as relics also.  Jewels are supposed to be found after cremation in the ashes of those particularly holy, and certainly in the case of the Buddha himself.  Sometimes, <a href="perigoku.htm#relics">ignorant people</a> make fun of Buddhist relics the way they are accustomed to do with the Christian variety.  However, unlike Christian relics, Buddhist relics are usually the result of cremation, something Christians long avoided.  It also took some time for cremation to become common in China, or even in Japan.  And in Japan there is rare tradition of "self-mummification," whereby the entire body of a monk may be displayed as a relic.  But the proper and distinctive relics of Buddhism, from the earliest days, are jewels.

<P>That the Buddha may originally have been just a person is not something extraordinary in Indian religion, where in Buddhism, Jainism, and Hinduism it is possible for <a href="gods.htm#gods">ordinary human beings</a> to become morally and spiritually superior to the gods.  Especially noteworthy is the belief that in achieving Enlightenment, the Buddha acquired supernatural powers.  These powers were:

<P><ol>
<li>Psychokinesis, the power to move objects with the mind;
<li>Clairaudience, the power to hear sounds at extraordinary distances;
<li>Telepathy, the power to read the minds of others;
<li>Retrocognition, the power to know one's own previous existences;
<li>Clairvoyance, the power to see and know things at a distance; and,
<li>Knowledge of the destruction of the defiling impulses, such as would lead to Enlightenment and <I>Nirv&acirc;n.a</I>.
</ol> 

<P>These supernatural and extrasensory powers, it should be noted, do not actually add up to either omniscience or omnipotence, or even immortality -- there was debate about whether they meant that the Buddha did not need to ask directions when he entered a strange town.  They are enough, however, to enable the Buddha to discover and verify the essentials of Buddhist doctrine, as well as to function in this world at a level far beyond ordinary human abilities.  These may seem like modest claims in comparison to the divinities of other religions, but they are certainly rather more than what is claimed by those we would regard as merely philosophers -- or than is expected by those looking for a primarily <a href="why.htm">humanistic</a> and rationalistic religion.

<P><img src="images/greek/swastika.gif" align=right>The <I>swastika</I> is often associated with Buddhism in East Asia.  It is character number 7032 in <I>Mathews' Chinese-English Dictionary</I> [Harvard University Press, 1972, p. 1042], pronounced <B>w&agrave;n</B>.  In a place like Japan it is often found on maps marking the location of Buddhist temples.  The symbol and the name, however, both come from <a href="cognates.htm#sanskrit">India</a>.  The bar at the top of the Nazi swastika points to the right.  And while the Indian and Chinese swastika tends to point to the left, observers will notice that this is not always the case, even after World War II.  Although the Nazi swastika seems to turn to the right, and the Buddhist to the left, in Buddhist terms it would make more sense to see the Nazi form as "left-handed," i.e. dark, violent, and transgressive (<a href="#vajra">Tantric</a>), and the common Buddhist form as "right-handed," i.e. proper, non-violent, and observant of the Precepts.

<P>It has proven uncommonly difficult to run down how "S&acirc;rn&acirc;th" is written in <a href="cognates.htm#sanskrit">Devan&acirc;gar&icirc;</a>.  Articles on line about S&acirc;rn&acirc;th do not show it, although some indicate the long vowels (S&acirc;rn&acirc;th) and some don't (Sarnath).  With the long vowels, writing the name the way it looks would be <img src="images/greek/sarnath2.gif" align=middle>.  However, if we go to Google Maps, and look at Sarnath on the map of India, it is written below as <img src="images/greek/sarnath.gif" align=middle>, "S&acirc;ran&acirc;tha."  Since Hindi does not pronounce the short final "a's" of Sanskrit, and sometimes even loses medial "a's," this writing will be pronounced "S&acirc;ran&acirc;th," and perhaps even "S&acirc;rn&acirc;th."

<P>So "S&acirc;rn&acirc;th" simply does not seem to be a Sanskrit name.  In the Wikipedia article on Sarnath, it says that the name is derived from Sanskrit <img src="images/greek/sarnath1.gif" align=middle>, "S&acirc;rangan&acirc;tha," based on a word for a deer, <img src="images/greek/deer.gif" align=middle>, probably because of the Deer Park at S&acirc;rn&acirc;th.

<P>For the versions of the names of Benares, see the <a href="caste.htm#note">note</a>.

<P>Another "Deer Park," of very different significance, was that of <a href="francia.htm#bourbon2">Louis XV</a> of France, the <I>Parc auc Cerfs</I>.  This is where a veritable assembly line was established for the mistresses of the King.  Most the monarchs of Europe, from Charlemagne to <a href="flanders.htm#monmouth">Charles II</a> of English, had mistresses and illegitimate children, who were generally given titles and sometimes became valuable agents of the King.  With Louis XV, there was an unusually quick turnover of these favorites, and one of them, who became the Madame de Pompadour (Jeanne Antoinette Poisson, d.1764), came up with the idea of preserving her status by becoming the Procuress of the King, finding girls and then providing them for him, at a facility, the <I>Parc auc Cerfs</I>.  As the girls became pregnant, they were pensioned off, modestly titled, and then replaced with a new girl.  The scale and organization of this, more than its nature, is what became a disgrace to the Monarchy.  Poor Louis XVI, who seems to have had no excessive sexual appetites, ended up paying the price for the scandal.

<P>A 1979 movie, <I>Winter Kills</I>, fictionalized the assassination of <a href="presiden.htm#35">John F. Kennedy</a>, and it included a part played by Elizabeth Taylor (d.2011) as "The President's Procuress."  From what we know now, the sexual appetite of President Kennedy may have been comparable to Louis XV, but he does not seem to have needed a Madame de Pompadour.  Modern politicians have had an endless line of available young women from interns, campaign workers, secretaries, etc.  Many may even count as what are called in the music industry "groupies," i.e. young women who seek proximity to celebrities just to provide sexual services.  A paternity suit can also be counted on to provide income even from brief encounters.  Thus, actress Liv Tyler was only the illegitimate daughter of singer Steven Tyler and was born Liv Rundgren, after her mother's husband.  Her actual paternity was concealed from her until she was 11 -- although her mother had never sued Steven Tyler as the biological father.  The prudent celebrity need not engage in any harassment or coercion.  The puzzle of <a href="presiden.htm#42">Bill Clinton</a>, for instance, is that the availablity of willing women was not enough, and his preferences came to include <a href="valley/dilemmas.htm#clinton">sexual assault</a>.  If Clinton had any illegitimate children, this has not come to light.

<H3 ALIGN="center">The Basic Teachings of Buddhism, Note 2;<br><I>Why Buddhism Is True:<br>The Science and Philosophy of Meditation and Enlightenment</I>,<br>by Robert Wright, Simon & Schuster, 2017</H3>

<P><center><img src="images/key.gif"></center>

<P>While we may get the right idea about distortions of Buddhism from "YogaGlo," a weightier example may be this book by Robert Wright (a journalist who, however, teaches classes at Princeton University and the University of Pennsylvania -- without graduate credentials? -- I thought that no one got hired at universities anymore without a Ph.D. in hand -- that's what they told me....), which was excerpted in the "Review" section of <I>The Wall Street Journal</I> of July 29-30, 2017 [p.C1].  But this was not a review of the book, but an essay by the author himself.  The piece is titled "The Meditation Cure" and subtitled "A basic practice of Buddhism turns out to be one of the best ways to deal with the anxieties and appetites bequeathed to us by our evolutionary history."  The "evolutionary history" part involves Charles Darwin, who is featured on the second page in a pair of matching photographs of Darwin and a statue of the Buddha.  The implication is somehow "separated at birth."

<P>For a book entitled <I>Why Buddhism Is True</I>, we find substantial portions of Buddhist doctrine and practice ignored.  Thus, there is nothing about karma (<img src="images/greek/karman.gif" align=middle>), karmic recompense, or rebirth.  Certainly no heavens or hells.  Nor does the practice here involve something essential to the practice of Buddhism ever since the Buddha, namely, monasticism.  No "truth of Buddhism" is going to motivate Robert Wright to renounce the world and become a mendicant, as did Siddhartha Gautama.  Probably Wright has never seen a dead man, or a mendicant (panhandlers don't count), by the roadside -- sights that are not all that unusual in India today.

<P>These are characteristic oversights in the materialistic and naturalistic treatment of Buddhism by modern secular elites; and the result is an idiosynscratic and ahistorical version of "Buddhism" that would not be recongizable to most Buddhists in history, let alone the Buddha himself.  The loss of karmic recompense, of course, entails the loss of the entire moral dimension of Buddhism, i.e. of the Dharma, <img src="images/greek/dharma.gif" align=middle>, itself a moral doctrine.  That Buddhist practice was to acquire <I>merit</I>, upon which spiritual progress depends, is entirely avoided, and voided.  This is characteristic in its own way of the "feel good, anything goes" principles of pop psychology.  <a href="jung.htm">Carl Jung</a> could recognize here a development of his "self-realization" psychology, but he would be appalled at the amoral form it has taken.

<P>The trivialization of suffering is going full blast here, as we find Wright saying:

<P><blockquote>Though the Buddha is famous for asserting that life is full of suffering, some scholars say that's an incomplete rendering of his message and that the word translatted as "suffering," <I>dukkha</I> [<I>sic</I>], could be translated as "unsatisfactoriness."</blockquote>

<P>I have noted this "translation" of <img src="images/greek/duhkha.gif" align=middle>, <I>duhka</I>.  While "unsatisfactoriness" is a problem, birth, death, disease, and old age are more what we would consider in terms of how "unsatisfactoriness" itself is an "incomplete" characterization of the human condition. Wright does not consider these canonical examples of suffering, which no amount of meditation alone will remedy. Instead, Wright worries about modern anxieties and addictions, including the fear of public speaking.  The Buddha's own example of public speaking is cited, but not his assertion, "there still remain birth, old age, death, sorrow, lamentation, misery, grief, and despair, for the extinction of which in the present life I am prescribing," which could easily be addressed specifically to Wright's idea of the goals of Buddhism.

<P>The most revealing thing about Wright's approach is his attempt to link Buddhism with Darwin and Evolution.  Thus, "We don't generally think of Darwin and the Buddha as being on the same wavelength, but in this and other ways their worldviews turn out to harmonize nicely."  <img src="images/dependen.gif" align=right>Not, as it happens, in the least.  Their "worldviews" are more in the manner of opposites and contradictions than of "being on the same wavelength."

<P>Thus, the basic principle of Evolution is, as Wright admits, <I>survival</I>.  But survival means the <I>continuation</I> of life, while the goal of the doctrine and the practice of the Buddha was the "extinction" of rebirth and the <I>avoidance</I> of further life in <I>samsara</I>.  Thus, Wright sees Buddhist practice as a way of <I>reconciling</I> us to the nature of human life.  There are, indeed, some Mah&acirc;y&acirc;na schools, like Zen, that promote this idea.  If the antinomian character of Zen had not also erased moral discourse and allowed, by implication, the <a href="divebomb.htm">Rape of Nanking</a>, we might take this more seriously.

<P>Mr. Wright, of course, doesn't examine any of these problems.  He has entirely psychologized Buddhism and, by the implicit denial of karmic causality and recompense, and the implicit affirmation of naturalism and materialism, he has committed several errors that have always been regarded as serious heresies in Buddhism.  Indeed, the traditional accusation of Hinduism against Buddhism, that it eliminates morality (by ignoring <a href="caste.htm">caste</a>), would be true with Robert Wright.

<P><blockquote>And if Darwin were around today, and joined the mindfulness meditation movement, he might thank the Buddha for coming up with a way to address the problem.</blockquote>

<P>Note that "right mindfulness," <img src="images/greek/samyak3.gif" align=middle><img src="images/greek/smrti.gif" align=middle>, is only the 7th part of the Eightfold Way.  So Mr. Wright has forgotten the 8th part, <img src="images/greek/samyak.gif" align=middle><img src="images/greek/samadhi.gif" align=middle>, "right mediation," even though he seems to be talking about meditation.

<P>I doubt that Darwin would thank the Buddha, or the Buddha either Darwin or Robert Wright.  Calming anxiety is a means of Buddhist practice, not its goal.  Calming enables us to let go of attachments, not just to addictions, but to everything.  Without attachments, karma will not cause rebirth, and we will find the "extinction" of "birth, old age, death, sorrow, lamentation, misery, grief, and despair," all of which continue even if Wright is able to do his Power Point presentations.  The alternative is <img src="images/greek/nirvana.gif" align=middle>, <I>Nirv&acirc;n.a</I>, which Wright does not mention.

<P>The true reconciliation of Buddhism and Darwin is in <a href="arthur.htm">Arthur Schopenhauer</a>, who matches Darwin's principle of survival (and lived to see the publication of <I>The Origin of Species</I>), with the blind drive of the all-consuming <I>Will</I>.  No more than Natural Selection, the Will cares not the least for our feelings or happiness.  And Schopenhauer's response is <I>the denial of the Will</I>, which is much closer to Buddhist detachment than is Wright's prescriptions for anxieties and addictions.  Wright, after all, does not anticipate the <I>extinction</I> of "craving," only its <I>moderation</I> to the reasonable level commensurate with prudent self-realization and flourishing, amid an abundance of consumer products.  The addiction, to both the Buddha and Schopenhauer, is to life itself, not to some imprudent magnification of its desires.  Mr. Wright has wholly missed this, and certainly wouldn't like it if confronted, say, by the Buddha himself -- with his simple garment and begging bowl.  Wright has not and will not be joining the <I>Sangha</I>.

BASIC BUDDHIST PHILOSOPHICAL DOCTRINES</H1>

<p><center><img src="images/key.gif"></center>

<P>There are some philosophical doctrines that are so early and so fundamental to Buddhism that denials of them tend to be regarded as profoundly non-Buddhist heterodoxies.  All <a href="buddhism.htm#stages">forms of Buddhism</a> endeavor to maintain these principles.

<ol>
<li><a name="moment"><I>Momentariness</I>:  Nothing exists for any length of time.  There is no <a href="essence.htm"><I>substance</I></a> or duration to things.  Each moment is an entirely new existence, which is succeeded by an entirely new existence.  The only connection between one thing and the next is that one causes the next.  This doctrine sounds much like the Greek philosopher Heraclitus.  You cannot step into the same river twice.  The "things" tend to be called the <I>dharmas</I> in Buddhist thought.<P>

<li><a name="relative"><I>Relative Existence</I> or <I>No Self Nature</I>:  Nothing has a <a href="essence.htm"><I>essence</I></a>, nature, or character by itself.  Things in isolation are <img src="images/greek/shunya.gif" align=middle>, <I>sh&ucirc;nya</I>, "empty."  The nature of things only exists in relation to everything else that exists.  Existence as we know it is thus completely relative and conditioned by everything else.  Only <I>Nirv&acirc;n.a</I> would be unconditioned, although we cannot know what it is like.  The distinction between the conditioned reality that we know and the unconditioned reality that we do not know is similar to the distinction between <I>phenomena</I> and <I>things-in-themselves</I> made by the German philosopher <a href="kant.htm">Immanuel Kant</a>.  The notion that the <I>dharmas</I> derive their nature from everything else has led to comparison with the "monads" of another German philosopher, <a href="leibniz.htm">Leibniz</a>.  The monads also represent the whole universe.  However, since the <I>dharmas</I> are momentary, this is actually more like the actual entities postulated by Alfred North Whitehead (1861-1947) in his "Process" philosophy.

<P><I>Sh&ucirc;nyat&acirc;</I>, <img src="images/greek/shunyata.gif" align=middle>, "Emptiness," is easily misunderstood.  It is not nothingness.  Emptiness is neither existence, nor non-existence, nor both existence and non-existence, nor neither existence nor non-existence.  At the very least, this means that we don't know what is left when we take away all conditioned relations.  Beyond that, it can mean that we <I>cannot</I> know what that is.  No Self Nature means that there are no <I>essences</I>, just as Momentariness means that there are no <I>substances</I>.<p>

<li><a name="noself"><I>No-&Acirc;tman</I>:  There is no Self (<img src="images/greek/atman.gif" align=middle>, <I>&acirc;tman</I>) in Buddhism, either as an essence or as a substance.  What we call our self is a collection of things, the "aggregates" (<I>skandhas</I>):  1) the body, or "form," 2) feelings, 3) ideas, 4) impressions, & 5) momentary consciousness.  There is no enduring thing present in the aggregates.  This critique of the self as just a collection is very similar to the view of the Scottish philosopher <a href="hume.htm">David Hume</a> -- though without Hume's critique of causality.  An implication of No-&Acirc;tman is that reincarnation cannot be <I>transmigration</I>, since there is nothing to migrate.<P>

<li><a name="nogod"><I>No-God</I>:  There is no Brahman or any other such ultimate enduring substance or nature to reality.  <I>Nirv&acirc;n.a</I>, <img src="images/greek/nirvana.gif" align=middle>, thus cannot be characterized as realizing either Self, Brahman, or God.<P>

<li><a name="dependent"><I>Dependent Origination</I>:  Everything has a cause.  A momentary existence occurs as it does because of a previous momentary existence, but the cause itself is also momentary.  Dependent Origination combines the doctrines of momentariness and relative existence and is why in the Second Noble Truth desire and ignorance cause each other.   That relationship can be expanded:<p>

<ol>
<li>ignorance (<img src="images/greek/avidya1.gif" align=middle>), causes
<li>impressions, having the appearance of (<I>samk&acirc;ra</I>), which cause
<li><img src="images/dependen.gif" align=right>consciousness (<I>vij&ntilde;&acirc;na</I>), which causes
<li>mind-body, "name and form" (<img src="images/greek/namarupa.gif" align=middle>), which causes
<li>the six sense organs (<I>s.ad.&acirc;yatana</I>), which cause
<li>touch, sensation, contact with objects (<I>sparsha</I>), which cause
<li>perception, sensation, feeling (<I>vedan&acirc;</I>), which causes
<li>thirst, desire, craving, <a href="greed.htm">greed</a> (<img src="images/greek/desire1.gif" align=middle>), which causes
<li>clinging, grasping (<I>up&acirc;d&acirc;na</I>), which causes
<li>becoming, arising, the will to be born (<img src="images/greek/arising.gif" align=middle>, arising), which causes
<li>rebirth (<img src="images/greek/jati1.gif" align=middle>), which causes
<li>old age & death (<I>jar&acirc;maran.a</I>), which in turn causes
<li>ignorance (<I>avidy&acirc;</I>).
</ol>

<P>Nirv&acirc;n.a is thus not the removal of an ultimate cause but the simultaneous removal of <I>all</I> causes, all of conditioned existence.  The interpretation of Buddhist doctrine discussed <a href="#">above</a>, that "suffering" is really more like unhappiness or dislocation, puts forward the notion that our understanding of Dependent Origination (now often called "Interdependent Arising") enables us to <I>adjust</I> to the world and thus live a happy and normal life.  This may be a reasonable <a href="#maha">Mah&acirc;y&acirc;na</a> or <a href="six.htm#japan">Japanese</a> interpretation, but the point of the original teaching (the Third Noble Truth) is that <I>Nirv&acirc;n.a</I> is to be attained by the removal of the causes of suffering, which means the entire <I>system of causation</I> in Dependent Origination -- to be free of the world, not adjusted to it.  The normal in this world, which necessarily includes birth, old age, and death, is what the Buddha wanted to avoid.<P>

<li><a name="karma"><I>Karma</I>:  Because there is no substance or duration in Buddhism, the Buddhist view of karma is different from that in Hinduism or Jainism.  Karma is only causation, without the mediation of any substance (<I>ap&ucirc;rva</I>, causal body, etc.).  Reincarnation thus consists in our being <I>caused</I> by something in the past, and our karma is simply the effect now of past actions.</ol><P>

<P>In the history of Buddhist philosophy, these doctrines created some difficulties.  If there is no self, then what is it that attains enlightenment or Nirv&acirc;n.a?  It is not <I><B>me</B></I>, for I am already gone in an instant; and if it is <I><B>not</B></I> me, then why bother?  Also, if there is no enduring self, then the rewards and punishments of karma are visited on <I><B>different</B></I> beings than those who merited them.  Why do <I><B>I</B></I>, instead of someone else, deserve the karma of some past existence?  The Buddha himself probably would have been irritated with the doctrines that created these difficulties, since he rejected theorizing (it did not "tend to edification"), and he would have expected no less than that such theories would lead to tangled and merely theoretical disputes.

<P>The important philosophical lesson of these difficulties, however, is whether the concept of causality (which is accepted with none of the skepticism visited upon substance and essence) can be used as a substitute for the concept of substance.  In all honesty, no.  Something rather like the Buddhist position, however, can be formulated by Kant, for whom the concept of substance applies to phenomena but has only uncertain meaning when applied to things-in-themselves.  Phenomena are only "provisional existence" to Buddhism, and the Buddhist doctrine of no enduring Self could easily be adapted to the Kantian transcendent.

STAGES IN THE HISTORY OF BUDDHISM</H1>

<p><center><img src="images/key.gif"></center>

<P>The history of Buddhism in India, which lasted about 1500 years, can be divided into 500 year periods, during which distinctive forms of Buddhism emerged.  This is an idealized and schematic picture, but it is convenient, and it can be matched up with where Buddhism spread during these periods and what forms of Buddhism became dominant there.

<P>Buddhist doctrine and practice in the earliest period were agreed upon in a series of Councils, sometimes reckoned to be three, or four.

<ol><li>The <B>First Council</B> was held shortly after the Buddha's death, at Rajagriha (capital of the Kingdom of <a href="sangoku.htm#nandas">Magadha</a>).  Issues about the conduct of the <I>Sangha</I>, the monastic community, in the absence of the Buddha appear to have been settled.<p>

<li>The <B>Second Council</B> was held about a century after the Buddha's death, at Vaisali (under Magadhan control).  Sometimes this is considered the First Council, or is confused with the previous one.  It began to agree on the content of the Buddhist Canon and on the monastic discipline, the <I>vinaya</I>.<p>

<li>The <B>Third Council</B> was called by the Emperor <a href="sangoku.htm#mauryas">Ashoka</a> and held at Pataliputra.  The content of the P&acirc;li <I>Tripit.aka</I>, "Three Baskets," is supposed to have been settled at this Council, or thereabouts in this period, consisting of the <I>Sutra-pit.aka</I> [<I>Sutta</I> in P&acirc;li], the sermons of the Buddha, the <I>Vinaya-pitaka</I>, the monastic discipline, and the <I>Abhidharma-pitaka</I> [<I>dharma</I> is <I>dhamma</I> in P&acirc;li], the philosophical development of Buddhist doctrine.  Buddhism was introduced into Sri Lanka (<a href="#ceylon">Ceylon</a>) as the result of Ashoka's own efforts, and the Canon in P&acirc;li was preserved there.<p>

<li>The <B>Fourth Council</B> was called under the Emperor <a href="sangoku.htm#kushan">Kanishka I</a> and held at Jalandhara (or Purushpura, Peshawar, Kanishka's capital).  This is not attested in P&acirc;li sources, and so one often hears that there were only three Councils.  The Council is supposed to have supervised the translation of the <I>Tripit.aka</I> into Sanskrit.  The Canon apparently had not only existed in P&acirc;li, but in other <a href="cognates.htm#sanskrit">Prakrits</a>, which were all consulted for a standard Sanskrit version.  It appears to be the Sanskrit texts that were subsequently spread to China.  The sutras of the Mah&acirc;y&acirc;na may have existed only in Sanskrit from the beginning.
</ol>

<P><ol>

<li><a name="hina"><B>Therav&acirc;da</B> ("Teaching of the Elders") Buddhism (called "H&icirc;nay&acirc;na," the "Lesser Vehicle," by the Mah&acirc;y&acirc;na):  In India, 5th century BC to 1st century AD.<P>

<ul><li>Distinctive doctrines:
<ol><li>The Buddha (Siddhartha Gautama, Shakyamuni) is gone, and individual practitioners must work out their salvation on their own.
<li>The Buddha was unique, and individual practitioners cannot become Buddhas, only <I>arhats</I> ("saints").  There will be a future Buddha, Maitreya, but not for thousands of years.
<li><I>Nirv&acirc;n.a</I> (liberation) and <I>sams&acirc;ra</I> (the place of death and rebirth) are definitely different.  <I>Sams&acirc;ra</I> is a place of suffering to be left behind.  <I>Nirv&acirc;n.a</I> is a liberation that is free of death and rebirth but is beyond description and rational understanding.</ol><P>

<li>Places where Therav&acirc;da spread:  Therav&acirc;da Buddhism is presently practiced in Sri Lanka (<a href="#ceylon">Ceylon</a>), <a href="perigoku.htm#burma">Burma</a>, <a href="perigoku.htm#siam">Thailand</a>, and <a href="perigoku.htm#cambodia">Cambodia</a>.  These places preserve the Buddhist canon, the <I>Tripit.aka</I> (the "Three Baskets"), in the P&acirc;li language.  During the Therav&acirc;da period, Buddhism also spread into Afghanistan, Central Asia, and Indonesia; but all those places subsequently converted to Isl&acirc;m.</ul><P>

<li><a name="maha"><B>Mah&acirc;y&acirc;na</B> ("Great Vehicle") Buddhism</a>:  In India, 1st century AD to 6th century.<P>

<ul><li>Distinctive doctrines:

<ol><li>The Gautama Buddha <img src="images/maps/buddh-1.gif" align=right>is <I><B>not</B></I> gone, and individual practitioners are <I>not</I> on their own.  Instead, the Buddha taught the dharma out of compassion, and his compassion would prevent him from being unavailable to practitioners now.  Indeed, to emulate the compassion of the Buddha, practitioners become <I>bodhisattvas</I>, who vow to carry all beings with them into salvation.  Bodhisattvas are also available, like the Buddhas, to help people work out their salvation.  Maitreya is presently a bodhisattva, but the most important bodhisattva is probably Avalokiteshvara, who developed into the Chinese goddess of Mercy, <I>Guanyin</I> (<I>Kwan-in</I> in Wade-Giles, <I>Kannon</I> in Japan).
<li>The Buddha was <I>not</I> unique, and individual practitioners who have become bodhisattvas <I>can</I> become Buddhas.  There are already multiple Buddhas besides Shakyamuni.  Most important are Mah&acirc;vairocana and <a href="elements.htm#buddhism"><img src="images/bodhi01.gif" align=right border=0>Amit&acirc;bha</a>.  Amit&acirc;bha is famous for his Western Paradise, or Pure Land, where he has Vowed to cause anyone who calls on him for help to be born, so they will be free of the world of suffering to work out their ultimate liberation.  In Japan Amit&acirc;bha is known as <I>Amida</I> and Mah&acirc;vairocana as <I>Dainichi</I>.  Most of the famous Buddha statues in Japan are <I>not</I> Shakyamuni:  the great outdoor bronze Buddha at Kamakura is Amida, and the Buddha enshrined in the <I>T&ocirc;daiji</I> ("Great Eastern") Temple in Nara (the largest wooden building in the world), is another Buddha named Locana.
<li><I>Nirv&acirc;n.a</I> and <I>sams&acirc;ra</I> are <I>no longer</I> definitely different.  The "Fourfold Negation" is applied to the relationship between the two.  <I>Sams&acirc;ra</I> and <I>nirv&acirc;n.a</I> are thus neither the same, nor different, nor both the same and different, nor neither the same nor different.  This allows some room for maneuver, which may have made Buddhism more palatable in China, where Confucianism never did approve either of the world-denying metaphysics or the monasticism of Buddhism.  Distinctively Chinese schools of Buddhism developed, like T'ien-t'ai (<I>Tendai</I> in Japan) and <a href="divebomb.htm">Ch'an</a> (<I>Seon</I> [<I>Son</I>] in Korea, <I>Thien</I> in Vietnam, <I>Zen</I> in Japan), for whom sams&acirc;ra and nirv&acirc;n.a were virtually identical, so that enlightenment and nirv&acirc;n.a <I>transformed</I> the world rather than eliminated it.  The paradoxical metaphysics of Buddhism could be assimilated to the similar paradoxical doctrines of the native Chinese philosophical school of Taoism.</ol><P>

<li>Places where Mah&acirc;y&acirc;na spread:  Mah&acirc;y&acirc;na Buddhism is presently practiced in <a href="sangoku.htm#china">China</a>, <a href="perigoku.htm#korea">Korea</a>, <a href="perigoku.htm#viet">Vietnam</a>, and <a href="sangoku.htm#japan">Japan</a>.  Buddhism was propagated in China by missionaries from India, like Kum&acirc;raj&icirc;va (344-413), who arrived in China in 401, and Buddhabhadra (359-429), who arrived in 408, and by Chinese pilgrims who traveled to India, like <a href="sangoku.htm#faxian">Fa-Hsien</a> (Fa<sup>3</sup>xian<sup>3</sup>), who travelled to India between 399 and 414, and <a href="javascript:popup('images/maps/pilgrim2.gif','pilgrim2','resizable,width=384,height=313')" onMouseover="window.status='Click for popup map of the pilgrimage of Fa Hsien';return true" onMouseout="window.status='';return true"><img src="images/maps/pilgrim1.gif" align=left></a><a href="sangoku.htm#xuanzang">Hs&uuml;an-tsang</a> (Xu&aacute;nzang<sup>3</sup>, 600-664), who went to India between 629 and 645.  Most of these figures concern a China of the <a href="sangoku.htm#north-south">Northern and Southern Empires</a> (266-589), when the country was fragmented, and when barbarians, perhaps more susceptible to a foreign doctrine, ruled the North.  These journeys were difficult, either by sea around <a name="text">Malaya</a>, where many ships were attacked by pirates or sunk by storms, or by land through Central Asia, on the "Silk Road" caravan route, through deserts and over some of the highest mountains in the world.  The highest peaks of the <B>Pamirs</B> and related mountain chains, called <img src="images/greek/dunya.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/baame.gif" align=middle>, <I>B&acirc;m-e Dony&acirc;</I> in Persian, "the Roof of the World," are all over 24,000 feet [<a href="#note">note</a>].  One story of a Buddhist missionary crossing the Pamirs, Kum&acirc;ray&acirc;na, father of Kum&acirc;raj&icirc;va, is that he carried a Buddha image during the day -- and the Buddha image carried him during the night!  Kum&acirc;raj&icirc;va, Fa-Hsien, and Hs&uuml;an-tsang all brought Buddhist texts from India to China and translated them.  <img src="images/bamedony.gif" align=right>The Buddhist canon as it arrived in China was in Sanskrit, and it included many special Mah&acirc;y&acirc;na S&ucirc;tras that are not in the P&acirc;li Canon (though many are now suspected of being Chinese forgeries).  The stories of Fa-Hsien and Hs&uuml;an-tsang's travels are important parts of Chinese literature, and Fa-Hsien's account of India during the reign of <a href="sangoku.htm#guptas">Chandra Gupta II</a> (375-415) is an important document for the history of India.</ul><br clear=right>

<li><a name="vajra"><B>Vajray&acirc;na</B> ("Thunderbolt Vehicle") Buddhism</a>:  In India, 6th to 11th century.

<ul><li><img src="images/vangulik.gif" align=right><P>Distinctive doctrines:  Vajray&acirc;na Buddhism is <I>Tantric</I> Buddhism, often called "esoteric" Buddhism.  Although it is sometimes also translated as "diamond" (i.e. "hard"), the <I>vajra</I> (<a href="kongo.htm"><I>kong&ocirc;</I></a> in Japanese) was originally the thunderbolt of Indra; and in Vajray&acirc;na it symbolizes the magical power of Tantrism.  We see a <I>vajra</I> in the right hand of the esoteric deity at right, in an illustration from Robert van Gulik's <a href="./ross/dee.htm">Judge Dee</a> story, <I>The Phantom of the Temple</I> [1966].  The staunchly <a href="confuci.htm">Confucian</a> Judge Dee, of course, strongly disapproves of this kind of religion.

<P>Tantric magic could be worked through <I>man.d.alas</I>, sacred diagrams, <I>mantras</I>, sacred formulas for recitation (the most famous one being, "Om, mane padme hum" -- "The jewel is in the lotus"), and <I>mudr&acirc;s</I>, sacred gestures.  This Tantric magic could be merely thaumaturgical ("wonder working") or could be regarded as means of achieving liberation in addition to or apart from meditative or meritorious practices.  Just as Hindu Tantrism expresses its magical power through goddesses like <a href="gods.htm">K&acirc;l&icirc;</a>, Vajray&acirc;na emphasizes female figures.  Vajray&acirc;na comes to balance male Bodhisattvas with female Bodhisattvas as attendants of the various Buddhas.  And while Buddhas tend to be regarded as male in all branches of Buddhism, <a href="gender.htm"><img src="images/arch-mf3.gif" align=left border=0></a>Tibetan Buddhism supplies female figures corresponding to each Buddha, like the "savioresses" <a href="elements.htm#buddhism"><img src="images/bodhi02.gif" align=right border=0>Green T&acirc;r&acirc;</a>, White T&acirc;r&acirc;, and M&acirc;mak&icirc;, who actually vow to always be reborn as women in the process of leading all beings to salvation.

<P>Vajray&acirc;na symbolism always balances male and female:  the Vajra Man.d.ala (or the "jewel" above) corresponds to the Womb (or Matrix) Man.d.ala (the "lotus").  The extent to which Vajray&acirc;na <I>practiced</I> real sexual union, been the physical male "vajra" and the physical female womb, as part of its Tantrism is unclear and disputed.  Often "right-handed" Tantrism is distinguished from "left-handed" Tantrism, in which the former practiced the union of male and female, in symbolic, iconographic form, while the latter practiced it literally.  While the "right-handed" forms are mainly what remain in Tibet and in Japanese Shingon today, there is little doubt that real "left-handed" practices existed in the past and survive to an extent in the present, and Tibetan art sometimes still portrays the more violent and disturbing aspects of Tantric practice -- rape, bestiality, etc.<br clear=right>

<li><img src="images/maps/buddh-2.gif" align=right><P>Places where Vajray&acirc;na spread:  Vajray&acirc;na Buddhism most importantly spread to <a href="perigoku.htm#tibet">Tibet</a> and then <a href="mongol.htm">Mongolia</a>.  In Tibet it assumed distinctive forms that are usually called <I>Lamaism</I>, since the monks are called Lamas.  The present Dalai Lama, who was the priestly ruler of Tibet until he fled the Communist Chinese in 1959, is from a line that is reputed to be successive incarnations of the Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara.  Vajray&acirc;na Buddhism also entered China, Japan, etc., as special "esoteric" schools, like the <a href="six.htm#japan">Japanese</a> <I>Shingon</I> school.  This often influenced other Buddhist sects without otherwise replacing their doctrine or practice.  <img src="images/potala.gif" align=left width=250>Mongolian Lamaism also spread to Manchuria, so that the <a href="sangoku.htm#ch'ing">Ch'ing Dynasty</a> of China was observant of its forms.  The great temple at <B>Borobudur</B>, outside Jakarta on the island of Java, dates from this period (c.800), and embodies Vajray&acirc;na man.d.ala forms; but in Indonesia Buddhism soon thereafter gave way to Isl&acirc;m, leaving only the island of Bali, mostly Hindu, observing older religion.
</ul>
</ol>

<P><center><img src="images/key.gif"></center>

<P><B>The end of Buddhism in India</B>.  Buddhism may have died out in India in the 11th century because:  1) It had become almost indistinguishable from the Tantric forms of Hinduism.  Sophisticated Buddhist doctrine did not appeal to most people, and the actual practices and iconography of Vajray&acirc;na could easily be assimilated into Hinduism.  And, 2) Isl&acirc;m arrived in earnest in India with the Afghan prince <a href="islam.htm#ghazna">Mah.m&ucirc;d of Ghazna</a>, who defeated a coalition of Hindu princes in 1008 and soon annexed the Punj&acirc;b.  Unlike Hinduism, Buddhism could not make the case to Mah.m&ucirc;d that it was really a Monotheism like Isl&acirc;m and should be protected like Judaism and Christianity (and Zoroastrianism).  As Buddhism was persecuted, conversions to Isl&acirc;m increased, and Buddhism declined.  By the time the British arrived, about 25% of India was Moslem.  That ultimately led to the partition of the country into India and Pakistan.  The Gautama Buddha himself has ended up being regarded as the 9th Incarnation (<I>Avatar</I>) of the great Hindu God <a href="gods.htm">Vis.n.u</a>, although the unflattering take on it is that he deliberately taught a false doctrine (i.e. Buddhism) in order to deceive and destroy demons.

<P><a name="mappo"><B>The Final Dharma Age</B>

<P>Another way of dividing the history of Buddhism emerged in the Buddhist tradition as a way of dealing with the prediction of the Buddha himself that the <I>Dharma</I> would only last 500 years.  This became a matter of concern in China, where Buddhism did not even become established until nearly 1000 years after the time of the Buddha.  Indeed, there was uncertainty about when the time of the Buddha had been, but soon enough it was obvious that far more than 500 years had passed.  The doctrine that was formulated in response to this we find in <B>K'uei-chi</B> (Tz'u-en, 632-682), founder of the Fa-hsien school early in the <a href="sangoku.htm#t'ang">T'ang Dynasty</a>, in his <I>I-lin-chang</I>, "The Grove of Meanings."  There we find a division into three periods based on the existence of Buddhist teaching, Buddhist practice, and Buddhist "proof," i.e. results -- supernatural powers and Nirv&acirc;n.a:

<P><ol>
<li><img src="images/maps/sangoku1.gif" align=right>The Age of the <B>True Dharma</B> (Sanskrit <I>Saddharma</I>, Japanese <I>sh&ocirc;b&ocirc;</I>).  In the first 500 years of Buddhism (sometimes put at 1000 years, however), the teaching, the practice, and the proof of Buddhism are all evident and effective.  This becomes the Buddhist equivalent of the "age of the Apostles" in Christianity or of the "companions of the Prophet" in Isl&acirc;m -- when the best exemplars of the religion lived, people whose achievements are now largely beyond the reach of believers (as most Protestants do not believe that any modern Christians can perform miracles on the scale of the Apostles).  It becomes, naturally, particularly associated with Buddhism in India, the first step in the <a href="sangoku.htm"><I>Sangoku</I></a>, or "three nations," ideology that later developed in Japan.<p>

<li>The Age of the <B>Counterfeit Dharma</B> (Sanskrit <I>Saddharma-pratir&ucirc;paka</I>, Japanese <I>z&ocirc;h&ocirc;</I>).  In the 1000 years following the True Dharma, the teaching and the practice of Buddhism are evident but the proof fails.  While uncertainty about the length of the True Dharma Age could postpone a reckoning, Buddhism in China -- which now becomes particularly associated with the second Age -- eventually had to face the fact that the full force of the Dharma, <img src="images/maps/sangoku2.gif" align=right>as defined by the Buddha himself, was spent.  This would seem to remove the point of Buddhist belief and practice altogether, but it was also something whose full implications most Buddhists were unwilling to accept.  One result was the popularity of devotionalistic forms of Buddhism, which substitute intermediate goals before final <I>Nirv&acirc;n.a</I>.  In Pure Land practice, the Vow of the Buddha Amit&acirc;bha enables devotees to be reborn in a Pure Land, where they will be free of suffering, let alone the Hells, and can work out their salvation without distractions (like hunger or sex).  Pure Land Buddhism, indeed, became the most popular form of Buddhism in China and <a href="six.htm#japan">Japan</a>.  Another approach, which we see in the T'ien-tai (Japanese <I>Tendai</I>) and Ch'an (<I>Zen</I>) Schools, was to redefine the "proof," so that avoiding rebirth was no longer the goal of Buddhist practice.  Instead, life in the world of <I>sams&acirc;ra</I> can become the equivalent of <I>Nirv&acirc;n.a</I>.  This gives to Buddhism itself a very different character, unlike the world-denying tendencies of India and more conformable to the sensibilities of both <a href="confuci.htm">Confucianism</a> and <a href="taote.htm">Taoism</a>.  This goes along with discussions about whether it was really necessary to keep Buddhist Precepts.  Nevertheless, we do have a continuation of traditional monasticism, and of course not everyone agrees with the new tendencies in thinking.<p>

<li>The Age of the <B>Final Dharma</B> (Sanskrit <I>Saddharma-vipralopa</I>, Japanese <I>mapp&ocirc;</I>).  If the Counterfeit Dharma posed a disturbing challenge for Buddhism, the Final Dharma was even worse.  At that point the real practice and proof of Buddhism are both supposed to no longer be possible.  Only the teaching remains.  While K'uei-chi didn't yet quite have to worry about that, by the time we get to the <a href="sangoku.htm#kamakura">Kamakura Period</a> (1186-1336) in Japanese history, it becomes widely accepted that the Final Dharma, <I>Mapp&ocirc;</I>, is upon them.  This is expected to last no less than 10,000 years.  After that, Buddhism will simply be forgotten, and ages will pass, perhaps a million years, before the arrival of the Future Buddha, Maitreya.  By this time, of course, Buddhism was already vanishing in India itself.  Some Japanese expected this, or were aware of it, others didn't believe it.  But it was the kind of thing to reinforce the sense of the fading of the Dharma.  <img src="images/maps/sangoku3.gif" align=right>The response was a <a href="six.htm#japan">period</a> of religious creativity, in which a number of Chinese schools were adopted and reworked (Tendai, Zen, J&ocirc;do), and some original Japanese schools (J&ocirc;do Shin, Nichiren) emerged.  Japanese monks ceased taking full monastic vows, clerical marriage became tolerated, sometimes sanctioned (in J&ocirc;do Shin), later even expected, and Japanese monks could easily gain reputations as formidable drinkers, despite the Precept against intoxicants.  To Buddhists elsewhere, this kind of thing often makes it seem that Japanese monks are no longer proper Buddhists.  In the Japanese tradition, however, this is all of a piece with <I>Mapp&ocirc;</I>, and the development of Japanese Buddhism was seen as actually making it the living center of the Buddhist world.  Thus, in the <I>Sangoku</I> ideology, Japan itself becomes the exemplar of the third Age.  This would have some unfortunate implications, when <a href="sangoku.htm#modern">Imperial Japan</a> saw itself as exporting its superiority to the rest of Asia.  Japanese Buddhist "missions" in <a href="perigoku.htm#korea">Korea</a> helped discredit Buddhism to many, resulting in large numbers of Koreans converting to Christianity.  Nevertheless, Japanese religious creativity remains impressive, as groups of "New Religions" and even "New New Religions" continue to draw on Buddhist, Shinto, and various eclectic sources, and some schools, like Nichiren, have managed to establish themselves among non-Japanese around the world.
</ol>

<P>While many Buddhists now no longer worry about the problem of the fading Dharma, there is no denying the statement of the Buddha, or the role that dealing with this has played in the history of Buddhism.

<P><img src="images/maps/himalaya.gif" align=right>On the southern slopes of the Himalayas are a chain of three states with similar and related histories.  In order of size, they are Nepal, the largest, then Bhutan, and Sikkim.  The size also gives the history of their degrees of sovereignty.  Nepal, warring with Tibet, India, and Britain, was the least compromised in sovereignty and is now completely independent.  Bhutan in turn became the vassal and protectorate of China, Britain, and modern India.  Sikkim was more or less ruled by Britain as one of the Princely States of India.  Although it did not join India in 1947 like other Princely States, eventually, in 1975, it was annexed to India.  This was approved by popular vote, but India had great strategic interest in the place, since it fronts on Tibet, which was conquered by China in 1950.  Since the Chinese subsequently attacked India and sought to resolve border disputes by force, this has remained a matter of concern for India.

<P>Besides its size and independence, Nepal also has the longest history of the states.  The Buddha supposed to have been born in its territory; and although about 76% Hindu, the country still contains a 20% Buddhist minority.  Nepalese history begins with the Licchavi Dynasty, which may have been an offshoot of the <a href="sangoku.htm#kushan">Kushan</a> rule of northern India.  <img src="history/nepal.gif" align=right width=100>Unlike Bhutan and Sikkim, Nepal has been strong enough to retain territory down into the Gangetic plain.  The official language of Nepal is Nepali, which is in the Pahari group of the <a href="cognates.htm#sanskrit">Indic</a> language family.  This was brought to Nepal late in its history by the <B>Gurkhas</B>.  There are surviving Tibeto-Burman languages in the country, and these now have influenced Nepali.

<P>Under the Malla dynasty the country became fragmented.  At the death of Jaya Yaksha Malla in 1482, a division was made between this sons.  This resulted in separate states of Bhatgaon, Katmandu, & Patan.  The rulers of Katmandu are in the main list at left.  Those of Bhatgaon are listed separately below.  This division weakened the country enough that control was lost over outer areas and further fragmentation occurred.  By 1669, one of these new states, of the Gurkhas, brought the whole country together under its rule.  This ushered in the modern era of Nepalese history.

<P>Limitations of Nepalese sovereignty were due to clashes with Britain.  A proper war with Britain in 1814-1816 ultimately led to a treaty in 1860.  The British were impressed enough with Gurkha fighting that part of the treaty allowed them to recruit Gurkhas into the British Army, where they often distinguished themselves, as in <a href="perigoku.htm#ww2">Burma</a> in World War II.  This arragement continued long after the end of the British dominion in India.  Gurkhas were still fighting for the British in the Falklands War of 1982.

<P>Another ethnic group in Nepal are the <B>Sherpas</B>.  Living in the mountains, where these are the highest mountains in the world, the <a href="#note">Himalayas</a>, the Sherpas are used to the terrain and the altitude.  Thus, attempts on Mt. Everest, at 29,035 ft., relied on Sherpa guides.  When Edmund Hillary (b.1919) first reached the peak of Everest on 29 May 1953, he was accomplanied by the Sherpa Tenzing Norgay (19141986).  At the time, the Nepalese were only allowing one expedition up Everest a year.  These days it has grown into a rather large business.  In 1993, 129 people reached the summit of Everest; 8 died.  In 1996, 98 reached the summit; and 15 died.  More than 150 have died on the mountain, and 120 bodies of climbers remain there, freeze-dried by the wayside -- perhaps <I>pour encourager les autres</I>.  Although Nepal was never a proper part of British India, Everest nevertheless was named, in 1865, after Sir George Everest, the British  surveyor-general of India, 18301843.  The mountain is <I>Sagarmatha</I> ("goddess of the sky") in Nepali and <I>Chomolungma</I> ("mother goddess of the universe") in Tibetan.  George Everest himself argued that the mountain should be recognized by a local name.  Of course, the locals did not <I>know</I> the height of the mountain, or its preeminence, until Everest's survey.

<P>The power of the Nepalse monarchy came to be compromised by noble families, the Thapas and then the Ranas.  This continued until 1950, when the Ranas were deposed and the power the monarchy reestablished.  The monarchy, indeed, has often been an absolute one.  Nepal, indeeed, has had great difficulties adjusting to modernity, both politically and economically.  As of 2004, 81% of the work force was in agriculture, and literacy was only 45.2%.  As with other politically backward and economically underdeveloped places, Nepal has been diverted by confused ideologies.  Thus, governments have often included <a href="marx.htm">Communists</a>, and since 1996 there has been a guerilla war carried on by Maoist rebels.  In 2001, the King and other Royal family members were killed by the Crown Prince, who himself then (reportedly) died of suicide.  The current King, his brother, dismissed the government in 2005, suspended civil rights, and assumed personal rule.  This earned the displeasure of India and Western countries that gave aid to Nepal, and the King then turned to China.  Since the Chinese seem to have gotten the Maoists to stand down, one wonders if the whole business may have been their doing in the first place.  None of this does Nepalese life much good, where a growing population but traditional life has tended to deforest the mountains for firewood.  Without enough of an economy to develop more modern sources of energy, conflict and poverty would seem to necessarily follow.

<P><img src="history/bhutan.gif" align=right width=150>The monarchy of Bhutan was founded by a Tibetan monk of the Drukpa subsect of the Kargyupa sect.  This priest king of the country (an Indian <I>Dharma Raja</I>), like the ruling lamas of Tibet, was chosen as a child, supposedly the reincarnation of the previous king.  Such a system made for very long minorities.  The system of regents for minor kings soon grew into the equivalent of a secular monarchy (the <I>Deb Raja</I>).  The table of sacred kings is thus followed by that of the regents.

With the occupation (in 1950) and colonization of <a href="perigoku.htm#tibet">Tibet</a> itself by China, Bhutan thus remains the purest example of an independent culturally, religiously, and linguistically Tibetan state.  As it had been with the British, however, Bhutan is in many ways a Protectorate of India, especially for defense.  Bhutan did join the United Nations in 1971. It has also experienced ethnic strife, with the Hindu Nepalese minority, over attempts to enforce Buddhism as a state religion.  Many Nepalese have fled to Nepal, creating a point of friction between Bhutan and that country.

<P>Sikkim, like Bhutan, was established by rulers from Tibet.  The Namgyal Dynasty, however, does not seem to have originated from monks, and Sikkim was not a theocratic state like Tibet or Bhutan.  Losing territory to Nepal, the position of Sikkim was restored by the British when they defeated Nepal in 1816.

But this also brought Sikkim under British protection.  The Lowland parts of the country were annexed to British India in 1849.  A treaty with Britain in 1861 effectively made Sikkim one of the Princely States of India, and Britain began handling its external relations.  In 1890, Tibet agreed to a border and ceded to Britain any rights over Sikkim.  A British resident was appointed, who, as in other Princely States, often seemed little less than the <I>de facto</I> Governor of the country.  <img src="history/sikkim.gif" align=left width=150>

<P>Although several languages are spoken in Sikkim, including Nepali, Hindi, and English, the one known as "Sikkimese" (or <I>Bhutia</I> or <I>Dranjongke</I>) is a cognate of Tibetan, like <I>Dzongkha</I> in Bhutan.  However, two thirds of the population are Nepalese, and Hindu, which led to a fate for the realm that Bhutan evidently wants to avoid.

<P>Unlike other Princely States of India, Sikkim retained its autonomy, by popular vote, when India became independent in 1947.  <img src="images/maps/himalaya.gif" align=left>However, the subordinate relationship to India continued, with India retaining also some supervision over Sikkimese government.  This culminated in 1975, when a referendum assented to annexation by India and the end of the monarchy.  India had already occupied the country, which thus became a State of India.

<P>"Roof of the World" would be nicely translated into Latin as <I>Culmen Mundi</I>, especially when <I>culmen</I> means not just "roof," but the "summit" or "ridge of the roof," from which we get a word like "culminate."  In Greek I don't know of anything quite the equivalent.  We can say <img src="images/greek/the-fem.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/the-gms.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/kosmou.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/stege.gif" align=middle>, literally "the roof of the world."  A version of this with "peak of the roof" would probably not be helpful, although that phrase could be <img src="images/greek/the-fem.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/the-fgs.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/stege-g.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/acme.gif" align=middle> or <img src="images/greek/the-fem.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/the-fgs.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/stege-g.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/koryphe.gif" align=middle>.  The word <img src="images/greek/acme.gif" align=middle>, "point, edge; highest point; best," is the familiar "Acme" of Roadrunner cartoons, as the fictional maker of all that is "best."

<P>The <B>Silk Road</B> -- a 19th century coinage in German, the <I>Seidenstra&szlig;e</I>, by the traveler Ferdinand von Richthofen -- means the routes from the Middle East to China, which mainly went through the Tarim Basin, either on the north side, below the Tian Shan, or the south side, above the Kunlun.  The center of the Basin, the Taklimakan Desert, is waterless, uninhabited, and, really, uninhabitable.  There was also a route north of the Tian Shan.  That was a bit further, but the Dzungaria Basin, which I've heard described as a "sage brush and jack rabbit desert," is not as lifeless as the Taklimakan.  <img src="images/maps/roof.gif" align=right>Today, the through rail line and the larger cities (like &Uuml;r&uuml;mqi) are on the north side on the Tian Shan.  All this is now in the Chinese territory of Sinkiang [Xinjiang], whose imperial and colonial status (like <a href="perigoku.htm#tibet">Tibet</a>) is rarely an object of concern for people otherwise indignant over American "<a href="antiam.htm">imperialism</a>".  Perhaps the most famous Silk Road site, the caves full of Buddhist art and manuscripts at <B>Dunhuang</B>, is just north of the Nanshan ranges, still in the Chinese province of Kansu [Gansu].

<P>While <img src="images/hiero/silk-1.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/silk-2.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/zhi2.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/road.gif" align=middle> is the Chinese for "Silk Road," the term originated in German, as noted; and so this is actually a translation into <I>modern</I> (<a href="yinyang.htm#dialects">Mandarin</a>) Chinese.  Both the characters <img src="images/hiero/silk-1.gif" align=middle> and <img src="images/hiero/silk-2.gif" align=middle> can individually mean "silk," "silk goods," and some other things.  Curiously, <I>Mathews' Chinese Dictionary</I> [Harvard University Press, 1972] does not list <img src="images/hiero/silk-1.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/silk-2.gif" align=middle> as a binome for either character, which means it does not occur as such in Classical Chinese literature.  The binome <I>is</I> listed in the <I>ABC Chinese-English Comprehensive Dictionary</I> [John DeFrancis, Hawai'i, 2003] with the meaning "silk cloth, silk," but with an asterisk that means "used only in compounds," presumably such as <img src="images/hiero/silk-1.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/silk-2.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/zhi2.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/road.gif" align=middle>.  This simply reinforces the novelty of the term in modern Chinese.

<P>The expression also gets translated into other languages, but there is little point in the exercise when it does not inform us about contemporary usage.  Thus, "Silk Road" in Latin would be <I>Via Serica</I>, which is a nice phrase, but, having not been used at the time, and with little modern Latin literature to feature it (I doubt it occurs in any Papal Bulls), there is an overtone of anachronism about it.  However, a Greek translation is of interest just because of the development of <a href="romania.htm#silk">sericulture</a> in the Mediaeval Peloponnesus.  Thus, the Greek word for "silk," <img src="images/greek/silk-n.gif" align=middle>, is attested in the 6th century historian Procopius.  Wikipedia gives a Greek translation of "Silk Road" as <img src="images/greek/dromos.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/the-mgs.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/silk-dg.gif" align=middle>, where we get a neuter <I>diminutive</I>, <img src="images/greek/silk-dn.gif" align=middle>, without explanation -- although this may reflect the Modern Greek form of "silk," <img src="images/greek/silk-m.gif" align=middle>.  An uncomplicated Classical version would be <img src="images/greek/the-mas.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/dromos.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/the-fg.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/silk-g.gif" align=middle>, "the way/road of silk."  Silk worm larvae were brought across Asia to the Court of <a href="romania.htm#justin">Justinian</a>, whether the route was called the "Silk Road" or not.

<P>The passes trough the Pamirs are so high, that familiar pack animals like horses and mules would simply die from the altitude.  Only yaks are adapted to the thin air.  But then yaks can't live at lower altitudes.  Every caravan (from Perisan <img src="images/greek/karvan.gif" align=middle>, <I>k&acirc;rv&acirc;n</I>), consequently, needed to begin down below with one kind of animal and then change over to yaks, and then back again once over the passes.  Modern trucks may need to adjust their carburetors.

<P>Following Central Asia, the <B>Andes</B> have the highest peaks in the world, culminating in Aconcagua at 22,834 ft.  North America comes next, with Mt. McKinley at 20,320 ft -- President <a href="presiden.htm#44">Obama</a> changed the name of Mt. McKinley (for assassinated President <a href="presiden.htm#25">McKinley</a>) to the "native" name "Denali," despite the designation as "McKinley" resting on an Act of Congress.  Then Africa, with Mt. Kilimanjaro at 19,340 ft.

<P>The <a href="armenia.htm#culmen"><I>Culmen Europae</I></a>, the highest range in Europe, are the Caucasus mountains, whose highest peak is Mt. Elbrus (18,510 ft.).  This is far from the population, historical, and cultural center of Europe -- but <a href="russia.htm#soviet">Stalin</a> placed a statue of himself there, to match the highest peak with the "greatest man" of the age.  The <a href="francia.htm#third">Germans</a> briefly visited the site in 1942, during the Stalingrad offensive, but don't seem to have had the time to remove the statue.

<P><img src="images/maps/alps.gif" align=right>The <a href="francia.htm#culmen"><I>Culmen Franciae</I></a> is in the Alps, whose highest peak is Mt. Blanc at 15,771 ft.  This lay in the historic Kingdom of <a href="francia.htm#media-B">Burgundy</a>, and later in the Country and Duchy of <a href="lorraine.htm#savoy">Savoy</a>, but it is now on the border between France and Italy -- France because Savoy was ceded to France in 1860, Italy because the Dukes of Savoy eventually became the Kings of <a href="francia.htm#modern">Italy</a>.  As such, the mountain is definitely in the population, historical, and cultural heart of Europe, with various routes passing around it to traverse the Alps between France, Italy, and Germany.  <a href="hist-1.htm#carthage2">Hannibal</a> marched not far from here.

<P>The "Roof of Francia" in Greek would be <img src="images/greek/the-fem.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/the-fgs.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/phrangig.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/stege.gif" align=middle>, while the "Roof of Europe" would be <img src="images/greek/the-fem.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/the-fgs.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/europa-g.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/stege.gif" align=middle>.  Note that Greek frequently uses <a href="russia.htm#the">definite articles</a> with proper names like Francia and Europa.

<P>Just to round things off, the highest peak in Antarctica is the Vinson Massif, at 16,864 ft.  The highest peak in the remaining continent, Australia, is Mt. Kosciusko at only 7,310 ft.  This is beat on two nearby islands, Mt. Jaya on New Guinea, at 16,500 ft., and Mt. Cook in New Zealand, at 12,349 ft.

<P>However, the highest peak in <a href="hawaii.htm#languages">Polynesia</a> is Mauna Kea ("White Mountain" from the winter snowfalls at the summit) on the Big Island of <a href="hawaii.htm">Hawai'i</a>, at 13,796 ft.  Measured from base to summit, Mauna Kea is itself actually the tallest mountain in the world.  Mt. Everest is at the edge of the 10,000 foot Tibetan Plateau, meaning that it only rises about 19,000 feet.  Mauna Kea, however, rises directly from the sea floor, which is at least 15,000 feet (three miles) down.  Base to summit, Mauna Kea is at least 5.6 miles, or 29,568 ft. high (or perhaps as much as 33,000 feet, depending on the reference depth -- sea level certainly makes this kind of thing easier).

The island nation of Ceylon is now, since 1972, generally known as <I>Sri Lanka</I>.  While both names are of Indian origin, the name change was a political decision that reflects the ethnic conflict that has convulsed the place since 1956.  "Sri Lanka" is now generally used, anachronistically, by historians, on the grounds that it is in the indigenous language of the island, regardless of the conflicts of language, religion, and history in which the name has a current, essentially hostile, even genocidal, political meaning.

<P>In Sanskrit, the island is <I>Simhala</I>, <img src="images/greek/ceylon.gif" align=middle>, or <I>Simhala-dv&icirc;pa</I>, <img src="images/greek/ceylon.gif" align=middle><img src="images/greek/ceylon2.gif" align=middle>, i.e. the "island" of Simhala.  This appears to be from the Sanksrit word for "lion," <I>simha</I>, <img src="images/greek/lion2.gif" align=middle> (or <I>singha</I>, <img src="images/greek/lion.gif" align=middle>, from which <I>Singhala</I>, <img src="images/greek/ceylon3.gif" align=middle>, is an alternative name for the island).  The word is still used, as <I>Sinhala</I>, for the language, Sinhalese, and the identity of the historic and largest ethnic group on the island.

<P><I>Simhala-dv&icirc;pa</I> is apparently the origin of the words for the Ceylonese used by the Roman historian Ammianus Marcellinus, <I>Serandives</I>, and for Ceylon by the Greek sailor <a href="sangoku.htm#thanesar">Cosmas Indicopleustes</a>, <img src="images/greek/ceylon0.gif" align=middle>, <I>Sielediba</I>.  Since <a href="archon.htm#pronounce">Greek</a> doesn't have an intervocalic "h," it is not surprising that sound has disappeared in many of the derivatives.  These words then look related to the Arabic word for Ceylon, <I>Sarandib</I>, which gets rendered into English as "Serendip" (e.g. "serendipity").  "Ceylon" itself, like Latin <I>Selan</I> and related words in European languages, looks to derive from either "Seran" or "Sielen."

<P><I>Sri Lanka</I> is also from Sanskrit, <I>Shr&icirc; Lank&acirc;</I>, <img src="images/greek/shri.gif" align=middle><img src="images/greek/lanka.gif" align=middle>, where <I>shr&icirc;</I>, <img src="images/greek/shri.gif" align=middle>, is simply an honorific prefix, while <I>Lank&acirc;</I>, <img src="images/greek/lanka.gif" align=middle>, is the name of the island in the great epic, the <I>Ramayana</I>.  This is not entirely a positive association, since Lanka is ruled by the R&acirc;kshasa Demons and their King R&acirc;vana.   R&acirc;vana kidnaps S&icirc;t&acirc;, the wife of King R&acirc;ma, an incarnation of the <a href="gods.htm">God Vishnu</a>.  R&acirc;ma leads an army, including monkeys led by Hanuman, to Lanka, defeats the demons, kills R&acirc;vana, and recovers S&icirc;t&acirc;.

<P>The demons, however, are not supposed to be the ancestors of modern Ceylonese.  According to the <I>Mah&acirc;vamsa</I> chronicle, the island was conquered by the Aryan <B>Vijaya</B>, who called the place <I>T&acirc;mra-dv&icirc;pa</I> ("Copper Island") or <I>T&acirc;mraparn&icirc;</I> -- <I>Tambapanni</I> in P&acirc;li:  &nbsp;This name turns up in Greek as <I>Taproban&ecirc;</I>.  Indeed, the Sinhalese language is an Indo-European language of <a href="cognates.htm#sanskrit">Indic</a> group, unrelated to the older languages of South India (the Dravidian) and Southeast Asia.  This attests to its introduction from the North of India, and the assimilation, at least, of the original inhabitants of Ceylon.  Vijaya, however, is not otherwise a historical figure, and its is likely that his story, and that of the continuation of the dynasty by his nephew Upatissgama, is largely legendary.

<P>The first historical King of Ceylon would be <B>Devanampiya Tissa</B>, who converted to Buddhism.  This conversion was effected by <B>Mahinda</B> and his sister <B>Sanghamitta</B>, children of the Maurya Emperor <a href="sangoku.htm#mauryas">Ashoka</a>, who are supposed to have <I>flown</I> to Ceylon on their mission.  Although this should enable us to date Devanampiya Tissa with some precision, I nevertheless find conflicting dates for him, either 307-267 BC or 250-210.  The latter looks more like it, since Ashoka is now dated to 269-232 BC.  An earlier date for Ashoka runs into the problem that his grandfather Chandragupta apparently met <a href="hist-1.htm#great">Alexander the Great</a>, who can be dated with certainty, and that we know of the Hellenistic <a href="hist-1.htm#note-3">contemporaries</a> whose conversion to Buddhism was solicited by Ashoka.

<P>The Chronicles of Lanka thus preserve some of the earliest information about Buddhism.  Indeed, the life of the <a href="#"><B>Buddha</B></a> is usually dated using the Chronicle statement that 218 years had elapsed between the death of the Buddha and the reign of Ashoka.  This is the source of the conventionally given dates for the life of the Buddha as 563-483 BC, though I get 487 for his death adding 218 to 269 BC -- we evidently have some small disagreements remaining about when Ashoka ascended the throne (I also see 274 as the date, which is even worse).

<P>The Chronicle figure of 218 years, however, has been questioned.  To cover 218 years the tradition only lists five kings and five masters of the Buddhist <I>vinaya</I>, the monastic discipline.  This would imply reigns averaging 44 years each, which is not impossible but otherwise seems unlikely for the era (see the similar problem for Egypt's <a href="./notes/oldking.htm#2">Dynasty II</a>).  As discussed by Hirakawa Akira (<I>A History of Indian Buddhism, From Sh&acirc;kyamuni to Early Mah&acirc;y&acirc;na</I>, translated by Paul Groner, U. of Hawaii Press, 1990, pp.22-23), northern traditions allow only 116 years from the Buddha to Ashoka.  This requires only 23 years for the reigns and the masters, putting the life of the Buddha at 466-386 BC.  This would seem generally more consistent with the evidence, such as it is, but the topic is one of endless dispute.  That the earlier date is <I>usually</I> given is a tribute to the prestige of the Lanka tradition in Buddhist scholarship and history.  This is understandable given the preservation of the <B>P&acirc;li Canon</B> in Ceylon and the attention that this attracted from 19th century Buddhologists.

<P>Following Devanampiya Tissa there is an obscure period, including a time of rule from the mainland of South India.  This area was the Tamil homeland, grew into the later Chola empire, and was in different eras the source of conquest and migration to Ceylon.  Considering the <a href="british.htm#ceylon">recent</a> history of ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka, we certainly get off to a bad start when the Sinhalese King <B>Dutthagamani</B> emerges from the shadows of history.  With a relic of the Buddha on his spear, Dutthagamani defeats and slaughters the Tamils.  The King feels that he has sinned with such killing and says to the monks sent to reassure him, "How shall there be any comfort for me, O venerable sirs, since by me was caused the slaughter of a great host numbering millions?"  The answer seems to be an extraordinary statement, coming from Buddhists (indeed, according to the text, actual <I>Arhats</I>, those who have achieved Enlightenment):

<P><table><tr><td><blockquote>From this deed arises no hindrance in thy way to heaven. Only one and a half human beings have been slain here by thee, O lord of men. The one had come unto the (three) refuges, the other had taken on himself the five precepts.  Unbelievers and men of evil life were the rest, not more to be esteemed than beasts.  But as for thee, thou wilt bring glory to the doctrine of the Buddha in manifold ways; therefore cast away care from thy heart, O ruler of men! (from the <a href="http://www.vipassana.com/resources/mahavamsa/mhv25.php"><I>Mahavamsa</I>, Chapter XXV</a>)</blockquote></td></tr></table>

<P>We thus discover that even Buddhists sometimes regarded Unbelievers as inhuman.

<P>Over the next centuries, we get episodes of rule from the mainland.  The Lambakanna dynasty, which begins in 65 AD, is overthrown by the Dravidian Pandyans in 432; but Sinhalese rule is restored by the Moriya dynasty in 459.  The Tamils return in 993, briefly created the Chola empire that stretches to Indonesia.  Vijayab&acirc;hu of the Polonnaruwa dynasty expells them in 1070.  The Cholas had not gone undisputed, however, since most of their rule was contemporaneous with a line of kings at Rajarata.  The Kalinga dynasty follows in 1187, but after Nissanka Malla (11871196), the state weakens and before long the country begins to fragment.  One noteworthy fragment is Jaffna, a Tamil state, of the "Arya Chakravarthi" kings, in the north.  I have not listed the kings, in part because I find two different lists which vary substantially in names and dates.  One dates the beginning of Jaffna to 1210, the other to 1240.  Either way, by 1461, the state is under the control of Portugal; and the line of kings ends, either in 1615 or 1620, replaced by direct Portuguese rule.

<P>Curiously, the Portuguese were not the first voyagers to arrive from great distances in ocean going craft.  The <I>Chinese</I> had beat them.  The great expeditions of the <a href="sangoku.htm#ming">Ming Dynasty</a>, led by <B>Zheng He</B>, called at Ceylon.  The third expedition (1409-1411) had the greatest impact there.  <img src="images/mingship.gif" align=right>The ruler of Raigama, <B>Vira Alakeshvara</B>, was defeated, made a captive, and taken back to China.  This was the strongest political and military intervention during any of the Chinese voyages.  The Yung-lo Emperor (1402-1424), however, was not bent on conquest and returned Vira Alakesvara to Ceylon.  It is not clear, however, if he was able to return to power.
				
<P><a name="portugal">The Chinese, as it happens, did not stay long.  The last of the expeditions returned to China in 1433.  The experience testifies to the position of Ceylon at a crossroads of the oceans.  This was already evident in the embassy that king Bhuvanaika B&acirc;hu I (1272-1284) had sent in 1283 to the <a href="islam.htm#mamluk">Maml&ucirc;k Sult&acirc;n</a> of Egypt.  Such relations are not surprising in that the Maml&ucirc;ks controlled all the trade that passed from the Mediterranean world to India.  Their monopoly is what motivated the <a href="newspain.htm">Spanish and the Portuguese</a> to look for alternate routes.  Thus, in 1498 the Portuguese entered the Indian Ocean by rounding Africa, something that Herodotus said the Phoenicians had done in the reign of the Egyptian King <a href="greek.htm#text-2">Neko II</a>.  A Portuguese fleet, under Louren&ccedil;o de Almeida, was blown into Colombo harbor in 1505.  This led to friendly relations with the King of Kotte, Vira Parakrama B&acirc;hu VIII.  In 1518 the Portuguese were allowed to build a fort, marking the beginning of the Portuguese presence in Ceylon, which rapidly passed through phases of trade, conversion, and conquest.  The last King of Kotte was converted to Christianity and in 1580 willed his kingdom to the Portuguese.  They inherited at his death in 1597.  With direct Portuguese rule, we start to get Governors, or Captains General, as in the following table.

<P>In the midst of the Portuguese conquest of Ceylon, we actually get the foundation of a new and durable Ceylonese kingdom, that of Kandy.  The Portuguese unintentionally helped with this, installing their convert, Don Phillipe, as King.  With Don Phillipe's death, however, a Sinhalese nobleman, Konnapuu Bandara, seized the throne, expelled the Portuguese, and created an independent Buddhist kingdom.  The Portuguese were never able to recover, and Kandy remained independent until British conquest in 1815.<img src="history/ceylon2.gif" align=right>

<P>The flag of Kandy, representing the last independent kingdom in Ceylon, was revived for an <a href="british.htm#ceylon">independent</a> Ceylon in 1948.  Since the flag could be taken to represent the Sinhalese, stripes were added later to represent the Hindu Tamils (orange) and Muslims (green).

<P>While the Portuguese were occupying Ceylon, in 1580 the Kingdom of <a href="perifran.htm#conquest">Portugal</a> itself became a possession of Spain.  This immediately put Portuguese colonies in peril from the <a href="lorraine.htm#netherlands">Dutch</a>, who were fighting their long war of independence (1568-1648) against Spain.  Thus, the new King of Kandy welcomed Joris van Spilbergen, a Dutch representative, in 1602.  Although joint action against the common enemy was soon in the works, things ended badly with the Dutch being killed instead.  This was straightened out by 1612, when the new King, Senarat, concluded a treaty with the Dutch.  Eventually the Portuguese were driven out, and the Dutch assumed their dominant place on the island.  By then (1658), Portugal was independent again (1640), but it was too late for many of the prizes of their former empire.

<P>After more than a century, Dutch rule finally ended because of a problem similar to the one that had undermined the Portuguese.  In 1795 Revolutionary France deposed the Dutch monarchy and installed a friendly republican government.  In 1806, <a href="francia.htm#bonaparte">Napoleon Bonaparte</a> revived the monarchy, but with his own brother Louis as King of the Netherlands, and then simply annexed the country to France in 1810.  None of this was agreeable to Britain, which became the principal enemy of France and of Napoleon.  The British moved quickly to occupy Dutch colonies and prevent them from becoming French bases.  Some of these would be returned to the Netherlands at the Congress of Vienna in 1815, but Ceylon (like the <a href="british.htm#southafrica">Cape Colony</a>) would not.  Ceylon thus became a kind of outlier of the growing British <a href="sangoku.htm#british">Indian Empire</a>.

The British would rule Ceylon for a century and a half.  After they absorbed Kandy in 1815, the island was completely unified for the first time in many years.  To most in Britain, what "Ceylonese" came to mean was probably little more than tea.

<P>An extraordinary development during the years of British rule was the interest of Westerners in Ceylonese Buddhism.  Perhaps the most notable name in this was <B>Henry Steel Olcott</B> (1832-1907).  In New York in 1875, with Madame Helena Blavatsky (1831-1891) and some others, Olcott founded the Theosophical Society, which embodied their interests in spiritualism and Eastern religion.  In 1878-1879, Olcott and Blavatsky travelled to India to create a new headquarters for the Society, presumably on soil more congenial to its values.  However, in 1880 Olcott went on to Colombo and there converted to Buddhism.  His enthusiasm for his new faith would have a lasting impact on Western perceptions of Buddhism, on Buddhist perceptions of Buddhism, and on the strength, it is often called a "revival," of Buddhism in Ceylon.

<P>Although Britain had renounced any official policy of proselytism for Christianity, private Christian missionaries, of course, had a free hand.  Christian schools in Ceylon had some success at winning converts, as they would long be successful in conveying modern Western learning.  Olcott, in turn, wanted to help Buddhism meet Christian missionaries on their own terms.  He formulated a catechism for Buddhism in 1881, wrote extensively promoting Buddhism, and even created a "Young Men's Buddhist Association" (YMBA).  The result was influential in what has been called "Buddhist Modernism."

<P>Olcott did not believe that ritual and superstition were proper to Buddhism and promoted the idea, now quite common, that Buddhism is really a system of philosophy, or a kind of empirical spiritualism, in its own way rational and even scientific.  What went along with this was a view that all Eastern religion was really, at root, like this, and that any differences between Buddhism and, say, Hinduism were only superficial.

<P>This is a view that is now also quite common, to the extent that popular culture lumps together Indian, Chinese, and Japanese religion as all subscribing to the same esoteric truths.  That this really has little to do with the traditional practice of such religions is obvious to scholars, and to anyone really familiar with the countries, is irrelevant, since an approach like Olcott's is <I>normative</I> and owes much more to the originally Western ideology of something like Theosophy than it does to anything intrinsic to Indian or Chinese religion.  Where the one parts company with the other is the most conspicious when we come to the <I>devotionistic</I> sides of the religions.  Thus, the most popular form of Buddhism in East Asia is the <a href="six.htm#japan">Pure Land</a> sect of the Buddha <a href="elements.htm#buddhist">Amit&acirc;bha</a>, who promises rebirth in his paradise even for the sinful.  This sort of thing was altogether too much like Christianity for someone like Olcott, and we get the beginning of an attitude that most of <a href="#maha">Mah&acirc;y&acirc;na Buddhism</a> is not <I><B>really</B></I> Buddhism (the only Mah&acirc;y&acirc;na sect eventually to pass muster would be <a href="divebomb.htm">Zen</a>).

<P>Thus, Olcott and those of similar predilections would find the <a href="#hina">Therav&acirc;da</a> Buddhism of Ceylon more congenial, though even this would take some cleaning up, to return it to the Purity of the early Sangha.  Such preferences were not without a tangible basis.  Sinhalese Buddhism preserved the <B>P&acirc;li Canon</B>, the oldest collection of the Buddhist Tripitaka.  In 1881 the Pali Text Society was founded by Thomas William Rhys Davids (1843-1922), a member of the British Civil Service in Ceylon. Rhys Davids had no sympathy for Theosophy, but his project would provide a scholarly foundation for whatever appropriation anyone wanted to make of Therav&acirc;da Buddhism.  A P&acirc;li dictionary had already been published in 1874 by another Civil Servant in Ceylon, Robert Caesar Childers (1838-1876), and Edwin Arnold's (18321904) popular and influential <I>The Light of Asia</I>, a handsome and sympathetic presentation of the life of the Buddha, had already been published in 1879.

<P>Considering the contemptuous and patronizing attitude of the Mah&acirc;y&acirc;na (and so of the Chinese, Japanese, etc.) for Therav&acirc;da Buddhism, calling it the <I>Hinay&acirc;na</I>, i.e. the "Lesser Vehicle," the esteem of Europeans for their own tradition would have been flattering to the Ceylonese.  With a Protestant rigor, Olcott and others would have dismissed the Sutras of Mah&acirc;y&acirc;na Buddhism as apocryphal or fraudulent.  I gather that the impression for many years was that P&acirc;li was the <a href="cognates.htm#sanskrit">language</a> of the Buddha himself, and that the P&acirc;li Canon thus preserves his actual words.  For all their Buddhist revivalism, however, Western Neo-Buddhists in general were (and are) not much interested in the <I>monasticism</I> of Buddhism, a characteristic that was undeniable, not only in every Buddhist tradition, but something that could hardly be missed in the P&acirc;li Canon itself, where a large part of the corpus concerns monastic discipline, the <I>vinaya</I>. It is hard not to see that disinterest as reflecting an originally Protestantizing attitude towards religion.

Ceylon became independent in 1948.  Like India and Pakistan, this was in the form of a <a href="british.htm#ministers">Dominion</a>, with the King of England still the formal Head of State of the country and a Governor General as his representative.  <img src="history/ceylon.gif" align=right>Ceylon, however, continued as a Dominion far longer than the others, for 24 years, until 1972.  This casual pace of development would seem to bespeak the sort of leisurely nationalism and complacent good will that we find in some other former British possessions.  We might be led to see the country as peaceful and happy, as indeed I would gather from my 1962 <I>World Book Encyclopedia</I>, which says that the Sinhalese are a people of "gentle habits" [Volume 3, p.277].  However, this would be a false impression.  The spirit of Dutthagamani had already started to revive, and riots had begun in 1956 where Tamils were attacked and often killed by Sinhalese mobs.  With "Buddhist Modernism" often celebrating the pacifism of Buddhism in general, and that of the Therav&acirc;da in particular, the ugly history that begins to unfold would be an anomaly and an embarrassment, if not a refutation, to its conceits.  These developments are discussed with the recent history of <a href="british.htm#ceylon">Sri Lanka</a>.

<P>The list of rulers and governors here is combined from lists given by <a href="http://my.raex.com/~obsidian/regindex.html">Bruce R. Gordon's Regnal Chronologies</a> and a number of articles at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.com">Wikipedia</a>.  Other information is from the <a href="http://www.britannica.com/">Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica</a> and print sources like the above referenced book by Hirakawa Akira.  The different lists sometimes give different dates or have other anomalies.  I cannot always tell which versions represent the best scholarship, so I have tried to indicate the variations.<br clear=left>
