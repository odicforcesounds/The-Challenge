<P><B>Isl&acirc;m</B>, <img src="images/greek/islam.gif" align=middle>, is the religion founded by the Prophet Mu&#x1e25;ammad.  The word is sometimes said to mean "peace," but it is <I>sal&acirc;m</I>, <img src="images/greek/salam.gif" align=middle>, that is the word for peace.  <I>Isl&acirc;m</I> means "submission, resignation," i.e. to the will of God.

This is related to Hebrew <img src="images/greek/shalom.gif" align=middle>, <I>shal&ocirc;m</I>, "peace," and the Ancient <a href="notes/newking.htm#pharaoh">Egyptian<img src="images/hiero/snb.gif" align=right border=0></a> root <B>snb</B>, "health."

<P>This expansion of the <I>D&acirc;ru-l'Isl&acirc;m</I> was the <B>Jih&acirc;d</B>, <img src="images/greek/jihad.gif" align=middle>, the Holy War.  Someone who does the <I>Jih&acirc;d</I> is a <B>Muj&acirc;hid</B>, <img src="images/greek/mujahid.gif" align=middle> (pl. <B>Muj&acirc;hid&ucirc;n</B>, <img src="images/greek/mujahids.gif" align=middle>).  <I>Jih&acirc;d</I> is now often said <I>not</I> to mean, or not <I>primarily</I> to mean, Holy War but merely a moral and spiritual "struggle" for perfection.  The root (<B>jhd</B>, <img src="images/greek/jhd.gif" align=middle>), indeed, does mean "to endeavor, struggle," etc., but also "to fight."  Different derivatives of the root, as with <B>slm</B>, are used for different purposes.  <I>I<B>j</B>ti<B>h</B>&acirc;<B>d</B></I>, <img src="images/greek/ijtihad.gif" align=middle>, is from the same root and can also mean "struggle," but it is mainly used to mean "independent interpretation" on a point of Isl&acirc;mic Law, i.e. independent of legal precedent (following precedent is <I>taql&icirc;d</I>, <img src="images/greek/taqlid.gif" align=middle>).  It is no distortion of <I>Jihad</I> to say that it means "Holy War."  Indeed, in the Middle Ages it was an important question whether Isl&acirc;m could be properly practiced in a non-Muslim state.  Even though Isl&acirc;m was supposed to tolerate "People of the Book," which originally meant Jews and Christians but in practice came to include Zoroastrians and even, unevenly, Hindus, this was only in a subordinate position (<I>dhimma</I>, <img src="images/greek/dhimmah.gif" align=middle>, the status of the <I>dhimm&icirc;</I>, <img src="images/greek/dhimmi.gif" align=middle>, the tolerated non-believer) -- Muslims being "tolerated" in a non-Muslim state was against the divine order.

<P>The treatment of <I>Jih&acirc;d</I> in public discourse does not always seem honest.  Thus, the former History International cable channel (now "H2") recently (12/10/08) aired a show called "Secrets of the Koran."  This was copyrighted 2006 and so perhaps was a repeat showing.  The show explained the ideology of <I>Jih&acirc;d</I> as the result of the <a href="outremer.htm">Crusades</a>, and otherwise positively affirmed that Muslims are only supposed to use force in self-defense.  But to suppose such a thing with any kind of superficial consistency, major events in Islamic history were then ignored or glossed over.

<P>The <a href="#siege-1">Omayyads</a> were never even <I>mentioned</I> during the show, and the original Islamic conquest of Syria, Palestine, Iraq, Iran, and Egypt, although visible on maps, was discussed in no detail and often only characterized as "spreading the Word of Isl&acirc;m."  This was a grave distortion when the original Islamic Conquest, which consisted not only of violent invasions, but was not even intended to "spread the Word" or obtain converts at all.  Isl&acirc;m was initially viewed as a religion just for Arabs.  The earliest non-Arab coverts had to become affiliated with an Arab tribe, and their status was subordinate.  Equality for all Muslims was, in general, the achievement of the <a href="#abbas">Abbasid</a> Revolution.  The Islamic Conquest was therefore in the name of Isl&acirc;m, but its purpose was simply domination.<br clear=right>

<P>Later, the show mentioned that the Crusades were elicited by an appeal from the Roman/Byzantine Emperor <a href="romania.htm#comneni">Alexius Comnenus</a>, and that this had something to do with the Turks.  Exactly what the Turks had been doing, however, was glossed over nearly as completely as the history of the Omayyads, and one might have derived the impression that Turkey had always been in Anatolia (they are not shown coming from anywhere else).  That the <a href="romania.htm#rum">advent of the Turks</a> represented a major surge in Islamic Conquest was not made obvious; and the viewer of the show might notice a hiatus between fending off the Crusaders and the <a href="turkia.htm">Ottoman Turks</a> arriving at the gates of Vienna.  In between, of course, there were rather serious events like the <a href="romania.htm#paleolo">Fall of Constantinople</a>, which get ignored.

<P>Obviously, if the ideology of <I>Jih&acirc;d</I> only exists because of the aggression of the Crusaders, and war in Isl&acirc;m is only supposed to be used for defense, <img src="images/killthem.gif" align=left><a href="regmoral.htm"><img src="images/greek/must-die.gif" align=right border=0></a>things like the Arab Conquest of the Middle East or the Turkish Conquest of the Romania and Hungary are going to be somewhat awkward to explain.  Hence the dishonesty.  It is as though Egyptians, Syrians, etc., on hearing the Word, spontaneously converted to Isl&acirc;m, with Christian counter-attacks constituting, in modern <a href="rand.htm#modern">leftist</a> terminology, "Imperialist Aggression."  No, the only thing about any Imperium that is really resented is that the wrong people possessed it.  "Secrets of the Koran," thus, unfortunately, constituted a dishonest apologetic, not truly informative history.

<P>Isl&acirc;mic rulers engaged in <I>Jih&acirc;d</I> were not secular rulers in the modern sense, but neither were Mediaeval Christian rulers.  In some ways Isl&acirc;mic rulers seem more secular than Christian ones, since their military origin was usually recent and conspicuous (the <a href="#mamluk">Maml&ucirc;ks</a> are the most obvious), while Christian rulers (like the Kings of <a href="francia.htm#occident">France</a>) might claim authority directly from God.  More important were other differences.  European states had a legal tradition from Roman Law that was originally independent of Christianity, while Isl&acirc;m had developed its own system of law.  European judges were thus secular officials, while Isl&acirc;mic judges were religious jurists.  Europe even had parallel secular and eccelesiastical judicial systems, which is why King <a href="perifran.htm#plant">Henry II</a> of England could be angry with <a href="popes.htm#salzburg">Thomas &agrave; Becket</a>, not for protecting the poor Saxons from oppression by the Norman King, but for protecting priests guilty of rape and murder from the full force of secular justice.

<P>Isl&acirc;mic jurists were the principal institutional existence of Isl&acirc;m, which otherwise had no priests or religious hierarchy.  The <B>Im&acirc;m</B> in Orthdox Isl&acirc;m might be learned (an <I>'&Acirc;lim</I>, <img src="images/greek/aalim.gif" align=middle>, "Knower," pl. <I>'Ulam&acirc;'</I>, <img src="images/greek/ulama.gif">), might even be a judge (a <I>Q&acirc;&#x1e0d;&icirc;</I>, <img src="images/greek/qadi.gif" align=middle>), but essentially is just the leader of the Prayer, with no particular religious authority.  (<I>'Ulam&acirc;'</I> or "Ulema" is frequently used for jurists and learned religious opinion in general; and, strickly speaking, the indefinite citation form for <I>Q&acirc;&#x1e0d;&icirc;</I> is <I>Q&acirc;&#x1e0d;in</I>, <img src="images/greek/qadin.gif" align=middle>.)  The institutional distinction in the West between Church and State made it relatively easy to separate these institutions.  This separation was not only less easy in Isl&acirc;m but the trend in recent years has actually <a href="afghan.htm#fascism">reversed</a>, with a reinstitution of Isl&acirc;mic Law in states that had previously adopted secular law codes.  This reversal has, not surprisingly, accompanied a renewed militancy and a sense of <I>Jih&acirc;d</I> that owes nothing to mollifying apologetics.

<P>Other comparisons have been made between the characters of Mu&#x1e25;ammad, Jesus, and Moses, since Mu&#x1e25;ammad commanded armies, had multiple marriages, etc.  Mu&#x1e25;ammad, indeed, had the responsibilities of rule, with a hostile enemy, Mecca, nearby.  This involved battles.  Jesus wasn't in any such position.  His Kingdom, as he said, was not of this world.  Moses did have the responsibilities of rule, though actual fighting didn't begin until the Israelites crossed the Jordan.  Moses didn't go with them, and Joshua then handled the military business.  Since Joshua was instructed by God to annihilate the people he found in the Promised Land, Mu&#x1e25;ammad comes off rather well in comparison, since the war with Mecca ended in a negotiated settlement where the only losers were the idols in the <I>Ka'aba</I>, <img src="images/greek/kaaba.gif" align=middle> (though there had been a fair amount of killing in the conflict, and Mu&#x1e25;ammad had in the meantime expelled the Jews from Medina).

<P>As for his marriages, Mu&#x1e25;ammad seemed to have been genuinely devoted to his wife Khad&icirc;ja, an older widow whom he married after helping her run her business.  Khad&icirc;ja was one of the first who believed that Mu&#x1e25;ammad was actually receiving a divine revelation.  He married no other until after she died.  I do not know how to judge the subsequent marriages.  At least some of them seem to have been honorary, with the widows of fallen companions.  His favorite wife, '&Acirc;'isha, was betrothed to him at six.  It was she who laid him to rest in the floor of their house in Medina, and the last person to set foot there for many centuries, as the Prophet's Mosque was built around it.  One might think the Prophet was simply heir to some of the understandable temptations of power, but this explanation is generally not allowed in Isl&acirc;mic tradition, since the Prophet is viewed as necessarily morally perfect.  That is hardly necessary.  The Bible does not present Moses as morally perfect -- indeed, <img src="images/muhammad.jpg" align=right>God prohibits his entry into the Promised Land as a punishment.

<P>At right we have been seeing an image of the Angel Gabriel leading the Prophet Mu&#x1e25;ammad on the miraculous horse Buraq, from a 15th century Persian miniature.  I include this because of the recent controversy over cartoons of the Prophet published in October 2005 in the Danish newspaper <I>Jyllands-Posten</I>.  By early 2006, Islamic radicals managed to stir up riots in many Isl&acirc;mic countries over the cartoons, featuring attacks on Denmark, the EU, and Christians.

<P>It was positively affirmed by the radicals that images of the Prophet are absolutely forbidden in Isl&acirc;m and that the cartoons were an intolerable slander against Isl&acirc;m -- except that the Danish cartoons were really very mild and the radicals had included some other cartoons, nastier ones, that had nothing to do with the Danish newspaper.  They were obviously <I>looking</I> for a pretext, not honestly expressing any reasonable protest.  Not only that, but what they positively affirmed was not true.  Although images have definitely been frowned upon in Isl&acirc;mic history, and often absent altogether, there is nevertheless no lack of them.  A favorite theme was the Prophet's "Night Journey," when he was taken up in a dream to heaven and hell, as we see in the image here.  The whole episode thus exposes the extremism of modern Isl&acirc;mic fundamentalism.  This is not the Isl&acirc;m of <I>The Thousand and One Nights</I> or 'Umar Khayy&acirc;m.  It is a <a href="afghan.htm#fascism">fascism</a> that derives from the least humane and most intolerant varieties of Isl&acirc;mic law, often that of the &#x1e25;anbal&icirc; school favored by the Wahh&acirc;b&icirc;s of <a href="#saudi">Sa'udi Arabia</a>, not to mention the dangerous, militant, and reactionary insanity of revolutionary <a href="iran.htm#pahlavi">Ir&acirc;n</a>.

<P>Apologists then accuse Westerners of hostile misunderstandings Isl&acirc;m, when the disagreement of the apologists is with the radicals, whose own interpretations often have substantial support in Isl&acirc;mic jurisprudence -- if indeed the apologists <I>really do</I> disagree with the radicals:  &nbsp;They often seem disingenuous to a suspicious degree.  It is also unsettling when opinion polls in Muslim countries show what are often majorities of Muslims endorsing radical views, such as the death penalty for apostates.  This sort of thing is not easily explained away.

<P>Ayann Hirsi Ali, "Notable & Quotable," <I>The Wall Street Journal</I>, November 22-23, 2014, at the Independent Woman's Forum's Women of Valor Dinner, November 19, 2014 -- note the arrogance and isolence of ignorant Joe Biden trying to lecture a Somali women, raised as a Muslim, about Islam.

<hr>

<P><font size=+1>People who are viewed as "insulting" Islam are regularly threatened with violence, including death.  This happens inside and outside Islamic countries, occurring in the form of legal sanctions in the former, with efforts to institutionalize such prohibitions everywhere, so that Islam could not be criticized even, for instance, in the United States.

<P>Yet most of the genuine insults to Islam these days come from Muslims themselves.  If anyone's purpose was to discredit Islam by vicious actions done in its name, there is now abundant evidence that this is the program of many Muslims, including several internationally recognized Islamic states.

<P>In April 2014, the radical Islamic group in Nigeria, <I>Boko Haram</I> ("Education is forbidden") kidnapped 276 girls out of a government school in the north of the country.  The leader of the group, <B>Abubakar Shekau</B>, subsequently asserted, in a videotaped message, that the girls were now slaves and would be sold as slaves.  "Slavery is allowed in my religion, and I shall capture people and make them slaves," he said.  This must be cold comfort for the <a href="antiam.htm">anti-American</a> ideologues who want to convey the impression that slavery was invented in America and was a unique evil imposed by white people on Africans, and that one of the worst and most unforgivable things about slavery was sexual expoitation.  Now Abubakar Shekau openly proclaims slavery and sexual slavery part of the program of Islamic revival, and he is correct in terms of traditional Islamic law, where slaves are indeed the sexual property of their owners.

<P>Although Michelle Obama joined a Twitter campaign to "free our girls," the girls mostly have not been freed, but have vanished into forced conversion, forced marriages, and slavery.  The Nigerian Army is so corrupt and ineffective (at least until the recent elections) that the influence and massacres of Boko Haram have continued to spread across northeastern Nigeria and now are spilling into the Cameroon and Chad, whose own armies now seem a bit more active than that of Nigeria.  Abubaker Shekau boasts of all these developments as triumphs, even as the Obamas, the American Left, and the "Mainsteam" media subsequently seem to have entirely forgotten about "our girls."

<P>Meanwhile, the Sudan condemned to death <B>Meriam Yehya Ibrahim</B> for apostasy from Islam, on the principle that her father was a Muslim, even though he had abandoned her at birth and she was raised as a Christian by her Ethiopian mother.  People claiming to be her father's family suddenly showed up and charged her with apostasy, perhaps in the hope of seizing her business.  A Sudanese court condemned Ibrahim to death by hanging for apostasy; nullified her marriage to her American husband, Daniel Wani, on the grounds that he was not a Muslim; and then condemned her to 100 lashes for adultery before her execution.  Since Ibrahim was actually pregnant, her punishments were deferred for two years, and she subsequently gave birth under degrading conditions in prison, where she is still held.  International protests have had no effect on the Sudanese government, let alone on the sort of general opinion <I>in Islam</I> that might otherwise make a difference.  According to opinion polls, most Muslims still think that apostasy should be punished with death and are thus complacent in the face of the outrage a case like this provokes among morally sensible and conscientious persons everywhere.

<P>Eventually, Ibrahim was at first given permission to leave the Sudan, but then she was rearrested at the airport.  After being released again, Ibrahim was protected at the U.S. Embassy.  On 24 July 2014, she finally arrived in Rome through the additional assistance and good offices of the Italian Government.  Finally safe in New Hampshire, the actions of the Sudan have come in for wide condemnation.

<P>Equally ugly and vicious, or more so, on 27 May 2014 a pregnant Pakistani woman, <B>Farzana Parveen</B>, was stoned to death by members of her own family in broad daylight and in full view of the public outside the High Court in Lahore, where she was going to refute the chargers filed by her family that she had been kidnapped by her husband.  The actions of the family thus tend to contradict their own complaint, and one begins to suspect that the charges were filed only to draw Parveen out in public, where she could be captured or killed.  This is in the despicable category of "honor killings" of women, of which there have even been examples in the United States, as when two sixteen-year-old girls in Texas were murdered by their own father, who then escaped back to Egypt.  At least in Pakistan, several of the perpetrators have now been arrested, including Parveen's father, although police present at the scene of the murder did nothing and, of course, it remains to be seen what will come of the case.  Surrendering at the scene, the father was unrepentant and said, "I killed my daughter as she had insulted all of our family by marrying a man without our consent, and I have no regret over it."

<P>The ideology of the "Islamic State" (IS, ISIS, or ISIL), that was established in Syria and Iraq in 2014, is that "People of the Book," Christians and Jews, are no longer to be tolerated by Islam.  This was a provision only for the early days of Islam.  Now, unbelievers of any sort must convert, leave, or die in the territory governed by the State.  Of course, Jews in the area, given the attitude of previous regimes, already had almost entirely fled to <a href="outremer.htm#israel">Israel</a>.  Now all the rest, mostly <a href="notes/note-n.htm">Christians</a>, must go -- although it looks like Shi'ites and other heterodox sects of Islam, constituting a plurality of the population of Iraq, are also not longer going to be tolerated by the Militantly Sunni State.  Thus, after apologists have told Western audiences about the tolerance of Islam for everyone, the fighters on the ground have instead taken to apply ethnic (or religious) cleansing, that is, where Christians are not actually executed, or Christian women and girls sold into slavery.  This seems to provoke rather more enthusiasm than outrage in Muslim communities around the world, even as we were archly informed by Obama and John Kerry how "un-Islamic" ISIS really is.

<P>Although now (2019) ISIS has been driven from Iraq, after hard fighting, and has mostly been eliminated in Syria, it has been regrouping with allies in Somalia, Yemen, Nigeria, etc.  It is not clear what has happened to its leadership, like the "Caliph" al-Baghdadi, who have always maintained a shadowy existence.

<P>In the news recently has been another case in Pakistan.  A poor, illiterate Christian woman, <B>Asia Noreen Bibi</B>, was arrested and tried for "blasphemy" in 2009 and condemned to death by hanging in 2010.  Although her sentence was upheld by some higher courts (Lahore, 2014), the Supreme Court of Pakistan voided the verdict 2018.  In January, 2019 the Supreme Court has cleared the way for her to leave the country, apparently to join her family in Canada.

<P>Ironically, in a 2018 election <a href="british.htm#ireland">Ireland</a> just revoked its ancient blasphemy law, which of course had not been applied for centuries.  The situation in Pakistan is very different, where flimsy accusations of blasphemy have been used to persecute or even kill Christians, often at the hands of mobs or prison inmates or even by prison guards.  A Government minister, Shahbaz Bhatti, and the Governor of the Punjab, Salmann Taseer, were both murdered, Taseer by his own bodyguard, simply for criticizing the blasphemy laws and the handling of Bibi's case.  One of the Justices on the Supreme Court asked, "Is this the face of Islam you want to show to the world?"  Indeed.  The fanatics are making it a very ugly face.  But the bloody minded and chanting mobs don't really seem to even know their Islam.  The school of Islamic law traditionally followed in Pakistan, the Hanafi, does not call for the death penalty for non-Muslims who might be considered to blaspheme against Islam.  At the same time, Bibi was originally accused by two Muslim woman who objected to her using a water cup that Muslims had used to drink water.  An argument ensued.  Thus, the original objection had nothing to do with Islam but reflected the <I>pollution taboos</I> germane to the Hindu <a href="caste.htm">Caste</a> sytem, from which Indians presumably would escape by converting to Islam.  But these now seem to have been imported into Pakistani Islam, with Christians regarded as the equivalent of Untouchables.  This is thin ice for Muslims, many of whom are suspected by Hindus of having originally been Untouchables themselves.  This encourages Hindu fanatics in India.

<P>With a further irony, Pakistan has long been a nominal ally of the United States.  Yet opinion polls seem to show that Pakistan is the most <a href="antiam.htm">anti-American</a> nation in the world, followed closely, as we might expect, by Palestinians.  But it is not clear what kind of grudge Pakistanis have; and the popular anti-American element is suspected to extend into parts of the Pakistani government, including the intelligence services.  That Osama bin Ladin lived unmolested in Pakistan for years, and was only killed in a secret American operation, would seem to reflect protection by powerful figures, powerful enough that no one in Pakistan could be trusted with information about the surgical strike to kill him in 2011.  The Pakistani Government objected to the raid, of course, but it seemed the sort of half-hearted objection that reflected understanding of its circumstances.

<P>While outrages by the <a href="hist-1.htm#taliban">T&acirc;lib&acirc;n</a>, <I>Boko Haram</I>, or ISIS allow us the comfort of seeing fanatical Jihadists as a minority of fanatics, the murderous mobs and celebrated assassins in Pakistan give a very different impression.  As the Justice said, "Is this the face of Islam you want to show to the world?"  For a great many Pakistanis, apparently so.

<P>Thus is Islam truly insulted and discredited, rivaling in moral perversity the now well-established tradition of "martyrdom" by the murderous suicide bombing of civilians; and Muslims are left with no reasonable ground for complaint when others view Islam with distrust, fear, and loathing.  When the "Believers" <img src="images/greek/believr2.gif" align=middle> come, it seems that others, including heterodox Muslims, have reasonably come to expect only murder, torture, and tyranny.</font>

<P><font size=+1>At Brandeis University, we are learning the hierarchy of the new multiculti caste system.  In theory, <B>Ayaan Hirsi Ali</B> is everything the identity-group fetishists dig:  &nbsp;female, atheist, black, immigrant.  If conservative white males were to silence a secular women's rights campaigner from Somalia, it would be proof of the Republican Party's "war on women," or the encroaching Christian fundamentalist theocracy, or just plain old... racism... But when the sniveling white male who purports to be the President of Brandeis (one Frederick Lawrence) does it out of deference to Islam, Miss Hirsi Ali's blackness washes off her like a bad dye job on a telly news anchor.  White <a href="feminism.htm">feminist</a> Germaine Greer [<I>The Female Eunuch</I>, 1970] can speak at Brandeis because, in one of the more whimsical ideological evolutions even by dear old Germaine's standards, Ms. Greer feels that <a href="notes/newking.htm#circum">clitoridectomies</a> add to the rich tapestry of "cultural identity":  &nbsp;"One man's beautification is another man's mutilation," as she puts it.  But black feminist Hirsi Ali, who was on the receiving end of "one's man's mutilation" and lives under death threats because she was boorish enough to complain about it, is too "hateful" to be permitted to speak.  In the internal contradictions of multiculturalism, Islam trumps all:  &nbsp;race, gender, secularism, everything.  So, in the interests of multiculti sensitivity, pampered upper-middle-class trusty-fundy children of entitlement are pronouncing a Somali refugee beyond the pale and signing up to Islamic strictures on the role of women.</font>

<P><font size=+1>Muslim clerics are threatening the lives of Jews from the pulpits of American mosques, and they are doing it with virtual impunity, say former US law-enforcement officials who worry that the rhetoric could lead to violent attacks.

<P>Over the past six months, at least five prominent US imams have been caught on tape preaching violence against Jews in sermons at mosques across America.

<P>Yet these radical preachers inciting anti-Semitic violence aren't prosecuted or even permanently banished by the leadership of their mosques.

<P>"It's outrageous they aren't immediately removed and investigated for what may be solicitation [to commit a crime of volence]," was the view of veteran FBI Special Agent John Guandolo...

<P>Jewish people already are disproportionately targeted for hate crimes in America, but recent sermons could fan the flames of anti-Semitism.

<P><center><img src="images/key-g.gif"></center>

<P>A new political crime has been added to <a href="rand.htm#modern">Leftist</a> demonology.  This is "<B>Islamophobia</B>."  The precedent for this term seems to be "homophobia," and both are about equally confused in their etymology.  A "phobia" is a <I>fear</I>, so "Islamophobia" should mean "fear of Islam," as "homophobia," with "homo" used as a prefix for "homosexual," should mean "fear of homosexuals."  This is not the way these words are used, however.  "Homophobia" and "Islamophobia" are supposed to mean <I>hatred</I> of homosexuals, and of Islam, respectively, where this hatred is the morally (and perhaps legally) culpable expression of bigotry and hostility.

<P>In "homophobia" this was already a tendentious reading of traditional attitudes towards homosexuality.  Certainly there are people who hate homosexuals, and are even willing to commit violence against them, and it might be reasonable to imagine people fearing homosexuals, if they think that the innocent can be "converted" to homosexuality, or that homosexuality is a <a href="decdenc1.htm">decadent</a> and disruptive influence in society.  But in general, "homophobia" is usually just applied to people who, largely for <a href="regmoral.htm">religious</a> reasons, and without any particular personal hostility or tendency to violence, judge that homosexual practices are immoral.  This is rarely addressed in an honest way in public debate, where "liberal" opinion is in the business of smearing traditional religion (or at least traditional Christianity).  Instead, "homophobia" has become a political slogan and a slur, whose meaning and implications are left unarticulated, and which itself becomes an expression of hostility and contempt for religious traditionalists.

<P>It is then ironic that "Islamophobia" should follow in the footsteps of this usage, taking advantage of its device as a political slogan and a slur, when in the modern world the source of some of the most intense persecution of homosexuals is from militant Islam.  When the President of <a href="iran.htm#islamic">Iran</a>, Mahmud Ahmadinejad, was invited to speak at Columbia University (at the time of his appearance before the United Nations), many of the <a href="antiam.htm">anti-American elite</a> were certainly hopeful of hearing a good diatribe against <a href="british.htm">Imperialism</a> and the United States.  Unfortunately, a naive, or perhaps hopeful (or both), participant then asked Ahmadinejad about the status of homosexuals in Iran.  The answer was that there are <I>no</I> homosexuals in Iran.  An informed questioner would have already known that they are hanged as quickly as they can be identified.  The sentiment that homosexuals should be executed had also been previously expressed by a British Imam, without consequences, despite laws in Europe that could construe such an opinion as an incitement to a hate crime.

<P>How absurd this can all get was revealed recently when a "gay pride" parade was cancelled in London, not because of anti-gay threats from Muslims -- which had actually been expressed -- but purportedly in "solidarity" with opposition to anti-Muslim "Islamophobia," which was said to be the moral equivalent of homophobia.  Why a desire to assert solidarity between anti-homophobia and anti-Islamophobia should result in a "gay pride" parade being <I>cancelled</I> was left unexplained -- as, indeed, one would expect the opposite reaction, that the "gay pride" parade, with an anti-homophobia theme, would be <I>combined</I> with a parade asserting an anti-Islamophobia theme.  Obviously, the fear of violence against the parade from Muslims led to its cancellation; but the organizers, in a sort of anticipatory Stockholm Syndrome, decided to dislay their political correctness by <I>identifying</I> with those from whom they feared violence.  There are few more bizarre contortions evident in contemporary politics.

<P>Ironic or not, the use of "Islamophobia" is an attempt to demonize those who actually do <I>fear</I> Islam, 

<table border cellpadding=10 width=250 align=right bgcolor="#cccccc"><tr><td>
<font size=+1>Jihad against America is binding upon myself, just as it is binding on every other able Muslim.</font>

<P>Anwar al-Awlaki (d.2011)</td></tr></table>

when such a fear is well justified by recent events and by the behavior of people in the Islamic world.  Since Islamists, terrorists, and assorted tyrannical regimes and radicals like to justify their attitudes and actions in terms borrowed from the Qur'&acirc;n and from Islamic Law, one might think that honest defenders of Islam would acknowledge this, find it an embarrassment, and attempt to both combat the radicalism and assuage the fears of its victims.  But this is not done -- except among a few well meaning Muslims who do not receive nearly as much attention as their militant brethren.  Instead, public apologists for Islam seem to want to put the blame on the fearful victims, while discounting or ignoring the well-funded popularity of the terrorists.  When Palestinians <I>danced in the streets</I> on 9/11, it was not because they believed that the Jews or George Bush were behind the attack on America, or because they believed that Islamic terrorism was an embarrassment to Islam.  They were spontaneously celebrating a great heartfelt victory in the Jihad.  Apologists who do not acknowledge this are simply exposing their bad faith and ill will.

<P>The conflicts, confusions, and deceptions in these attitudes came to a head with the proposal for building a mosque on Park Place, a couple of blocks from the site of the <img src="images/911mosq.jpg" align=right>World Trade Center in New York -- the "ground zero mosque."  We see the building on the site at right, with modest New York City police protection.

<P>There would have been a right way and a wrong way to do this project.  The right way would have reflected the concern of well-meaning Muslims to dissociate their religion from the 9/11 attacks and to express their dismay and mortification that the terrorists should have invoked Islam to justify the atrocities.  The mosque as an expression of <I>contrition</I> for the damage done by vicious co-religionists would have at least been a step in assuaging the justifiable <I>fears</I> of all the targets of terrorism.  Indeed, there <I>should</I> be such a mosque at Ground Zero, in conjunction with facilities related to the religions of all the victims of 9/11.  There were, after all, many innocent Muslims who were killed at the World Trade Center.  The project of the mosque should be making clear that the "martyrs" of 9/11 were the victims of the terrorists, not the terrorists themselves (for whom, of course, a "martyrdom operation" means a suicide attack).

<P>The wrong way to promote the project, however, is the way it has actually been done.  The leader of the effort, the Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf, himself was on record as blaming the United States for the 9/11 attacks and refused to distance himself from terrorist organizations like Hamas.  He and his wife have responded to objections to the project with accusations of "Islamophobia," by which they clearly mean, not reasonable "fear of Islam," but a bigoted and intolerant hostility for Islam.  Thus, they give every indication of militancy and would leave any reasonable person with the impression that the mosque is not an attempt at reconciliation -- which would be ill served by calling most Americans bigots -- but is in fact a <B>Jihad Victory Mosque</B> whose purpose is to promote an Islamist agenda as close as possible to the place were militant Islamists killed almost 3000 victims.  This makes the project an insolent gesture that both insults America and makes use of the anti-American "useful idiots" who are eager to cooperate in their own destruction.

<P>Imam Rauf appeared on "The O'Reilly Factor" on 8 May 2012 and announced that he was no longer involved with the Park Place mosque, citing some kind of disagreements with other backers.  It would be nice to know who those other backers are and what Rauf's differences were with them.  Nevertheless, in the interview Rauf keep talking as though he were still planning the project.  Perhaps he was just talking about his general goals.  Bill O'Reilly mentioned that he had long ago said that if Rauf would appear on "The Factor" and renounce Terrorism, O'Reilly himself would take up a hammer and help build the mosque.  Rauf brought along a drawing of a hammer, that he said was from his wife, and gave it to O'Reilly.  I did not notice, however, that Rauf ever did actually renounce Terrorism during the interview.  Perhaps my attention wandered and I missed it.

<P>We need to begin to suspect the motives of anyone willing to use the term "Islamophobia."  The Left admires militant Islam for its expressions of hostility to America, capitalism, "imperialism," and democracy -- i.e. for something that apologists want to deny that Islam actually represents.  The Left, of course, has no respect for Islam as a religion or for its traditional religious or social values.  All of these, from the subordination of women to the ferocious treatment of homosexuals, are actually anathema to elite political correctness.  But opportunism trumps honesty, and this is as true for the Islamists as for Western Leftists.  Both are pleased with the alliance, however Unholy to either ideology, as the old Arab saying (from the days of tribal vendettas) is well remembered -- "The enemy of my enemy is my friend."

<P>We see this alliance in various examples of what can only be called wishful thinking, if not outright delusion.  Thus, Hollywood personality Rosie O'Donnell, a homosexual herself, drew considerable attention to her assertion that Christian fundmentalists are as bad as Islamic terrorists (along with claims that the 9/11 attack was an "inside job," a favorite trope of the Left).  Since "just as bad" doesn't seem to square with the absence of Christian suicide bombers, mass terror attacks, or large popular organizations that preach Christian Holy War through terror and combat, O'Donnell seemed more than a little out of touch with reality.  Not as extreme but just as revealing was the speculation by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg that the perpetrator of the May 2010 attempted Times Square bombing was, "Homegrown, maybe a mentally deranged person or someone with a political agenda that doesn’t like the health care bill or something."  It looked like Bloomberg was <I>hoping</I> that the bomber was one of <I>his</I> political enemies (i.e. opposed to socialized medicine), rather than the kind of Muslim radical that he turned out in fact to be.  Bloomberg loudly supports the ground zero mosque.

<P><img src="images/nicholas.jpg" align=right>Meanwhile, the City of New York attempted to prevent the rebuilding of the St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church, which was actually crushed by the falling South Tower of the World Trade Center on 9/11.  Bloomberg did not speak out on this issue.  Fortunately, the church persisted in its right to rebuild, and now a glorious design has been approved, which should be finished by 2016 or 2017.  Adjacent to the 9/11 Memorial, which is open, bleak, and cold -- appropriately -- the church will display a warm glow from its translucent walls.  With elements borrowed from <a href="romania.htm#note-4">Santa Sophia</a>, the church stands in fitting contrast to any Jihad Victor Mosque that might be built.

<P>The courageous <B>Ayaan Hirsi Ali</B> grew up in Somalia, lived in Saudi Arabia and Kenya, and fled an arranged marriage, and Islam, to the Netherlands.  There she worked with Theo van Gogh on the movie about women in Islam that got him assassinated on the street.  She was elected to the Dutch parliament before her citizenship was revoked, probably because of the embarrassment she was causing to spineless Dutchmen like Ian Buruma (a Professor of "Democracy and Human Rights" at Bard College), who has publicly said that Ali is as much a fanatic (for freedom, human rights, and tolerance?) as the Islamists (for murder, terror, and intolerance?).  If Buruma means that this is <I>good</I>, he has not done a good job of clarifying his intention.

<P>Similarly, Ali has been confronted in interviews with the proposition that crimes are committed as much by Christians as by Muslims.  Since the common crimes of Christians are rarely framed in terms of a Holy War against infidels, or suicide bombings, Ali naturally found the proposition more puzzling than anything else; and we are left with the impression of a kind of <I>desperation</I> on the part of the interviewers to deflect blame from Islam and to create the kind of "moral equivalence" that the Left promoted, in relation to the United States and the Soviet Union, during the Cold War.  Most people see through this easily, although, as George Orwell said, nothing is so preposterous that an intellectual will not believe it.  People like O'Donnell, Bloomberg, and Buruma know that they have the "useful idiot" intellectuals on their side.

<P>In 2014 American "higher <a href="public.htm">education</a>" disgraced itself when Ali was at first invited as a commencement speaker at Brandeis University and then "disinvited" when it was realized that she might criticize Islam, and had done so in the past.  This was an opportunity for every other college in the country to scramble and invite her themselves.  Apparently none of them did.  All this was was after Theo van Gogh had been assassinated, after Malala Yousafzai had been shot in the head by the Talib&acirc;n, after the girls had been kidnapped and sold into slavery in Nigeria, and after many other cases of violence and oppression against women in Islam.  Since Brandeis said that Ali's views were "inconsistent with Brandeis University’s core values," one could be excused some curiosity about what those values might be, since critics of Judaism and Christianity, sometimes vitriolic ones, have been invited to speak at Brandeis.  The values, not just of Brandeis but of most other colleges in the country, are clearly those of <B>cowardice</B>, if not <a href="antiam.htm">anti-American</a> sympathy for the Terrorist enemies of America, civilization, and humanity.  This what American education has come to.

<P>Currently, the ugliest counter-examples to the good intentions of Muslims are the continuing attacks on Christians in Iraq, Pakistan, and especially in <a href="turkia.htm#egypt">Egypt</a>.  Churches are looted, burned, demolished, and/or bombed.  Christians in Iraq and Egypt are kidnapped and ransomed or tortured and murdered.  Women and girls are kidnapped, forcibly converted to Islam, and "married" to Muslims against their will.  Campaigns are conducted in Egypt that Christians families are holding their own girls "hostage" after they supposedly converted to Islam.  The government of Egypt does not even allow churches to be built or repaired without its permission, which is effecively never given.  Or, if it is, mobs often attack the churches, or even the whole Christian villages around them, during or after construction.  On 24 November 2010, Egypt security forces actually stormed the St. Mary and St. Michael churches, which were under construction in Giza, occupying them and firing live ammunition at Coptic demonstrators, killing at least four. The official complaint was that a permit for the construction had not been obtained, although actually it had.  Either way, a paramilitary attack, shooting civilians, is not the reasonable response to people building churches.

<P>The Western Press pays little attention to these atrocities, both because the Western <a href="why.htm">secular elite</a>, in the intelligentsia, academia, and the media, is hostile to Christianity, and generally kills stories about the persecution of Christians, and because the political <a href="rand.htm#modern">Left</a> is effectively an ally of <a href="afghan.htm#fascism">Islamic Fascism</a>.  Since Egyptian state security forces fail to protect Christians and often appear to cooperate in their persecution, including this recent case of shooting Christian demonstrators, while the government-controlled Press promotes anti-Christian hysteria, this puts the lie to claims about the general tolerance, respect, and good-will that Islam is supposed to show towards other religions.  That is not the practice on the ground in most Islamic countries, whether the Western Press reports it or not.

<P>On 15 April 2013, the Jihad struck a great blow against that hated symbol of American imperialism and oppression:  &nbsp;the Boston Marathon.  It also struck a blow against the idea that there is some sort of factual, moral, or psychological problem with fearing and suspecting American Muslims of nurturing and harboring terrorists.  It now turns out that the apparently nice Muslim kid next door, who hangs out, smokes dope, plays on the soccer team, isn't named "Muhammad," doesn't even look like an Arab (as was all the case with Dzhokhar Tsarnaev) might nevertheless be building bombs and planning to blow up children who are watching a footrace.  It is also a sobering lesson that the <a href="armenia.htm#culmen">Chechens</a>, whose main <I>nationalistic</I> complaint is with Russia, and with whom we fought on the same side in <a href="turkia.htm#balk10">Kosovo</a>, nevertheless harbor the same antipathy towards the "Great Satan" as other Jihadists.  The Leftist "Islamophobia" narrative is exploded.  Of course, since it was perverse, dishonest, and tendentious to begin with, there is nothing to stop it contining in the hands of the same blind <a href="antiam.htm">anti-American</a> ideologues who originated it.

The Arabs were the first Semitic speaking people since the <a href="greek.htm#assyria">Assyrians</a> to dominate the Middle East.  This broke up the cultural oecumene that had been created by the conquests of <a href="hist-1.htm#great">Alexander the Great</a> and reinforced by Rome, and it reduced Western Europe for some time to a cultural and economic backwater.  The poverty and ignorance of the "Dark Ages" was in fact a side show to the prosperity and learning of the Isl&acirc;mic Middle East.  In European eyes, this made Isl&acirc;m the successor to what Persia had been for the Greeks, the great looming threat of Oriental Despotism, now including North Africa (where, after all, the earlier threat of Carthage had been) and with the added twist of religious Unbelief.  This polarization, however, obscures the fact that Greece itself was essentially a Middle Eastern civilization, and that Isl&acirc;m itself had nothing else to build upon but a common heritage of Greece, Rome, Ir&acirc;n, Judaism, and Christianity.  <img src="images/maps/islam-01.gif" align=right>
Although perhaps alienated cousins, Christendom and Isl&acirc;m could have nearly equal claim as standard bearers of "Western Civilization," and the revival of European learning after the 11th Century undeniably owed a heavy debt to what Isl&acirc;m had been doing with Classical philosophy and science in the previous centuries.

<P>Although the Arabs tend to be thought of as desert nomads, the origin of Mu&#x1e25;ammad was urban and mercantile.  His home town of <img src="images/greek/mecca.gif" align=middle>, <B>Makkah</B> (Mecca), became increasingly hostile to his attacks on polytheism and idolatry, until he was invited to the nearby Yathrib as a mediator -- later marked as the beginning of the Isl&acirc;mic Era in 622.  Soon the virtual ruler of Yathrib, which then became <img src="images/greek/annabi.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/madina.gif" align=middle>, <B>Mad&icirc;natu-nNab&icirc;'</B>, the "City of the Prophet," or just  <img src="images/greek/madina.gif" align=middle>, <B>Madina</B> (Medina), Mu&#x1e25;ammad seemed to pose an even greater threat, and the Meccans resorted to military force.  Since the results of this were inconclusive, and warfare was very bad for business, the Meccans decided that if you can't beat 'em, join 'em.  Under a treaty, Mu&#x1e25;ammad returned to Mecca and smashed the idols.  Since the House of God, the <img src="images/greek/kaaba.gif" align=middle>, <B>Ka'aba</B>, then became the goal of universal Moslem pilgrimage, the Meccans ended up doing very well out of the transaction.  Mu&#x1e25;ammad did not long survive this triumph and was buried in his house in Medina, around which the Prophet's Mosque was built.

<P>At a time when the very existence of Jesus is often doubted, and that of Moses regularly taken as no more than mythic, the historicity of Mu&#x1e25;ammad has generally been regarded as secure.  Nevertheless, most of the information we have about Mu&#x1e25;ammad comes from much later sources.  Although Isl&acirc;m would develop a rich tradition of historiography, this did not begin until the days of the <a href="#abbas">Abbasids</a>, and many of the later traditions that are reported about Mu&#x1e25;ammad are rightly matters of scepticism.  The full treatment of "higher criticism" in Isl&acirc;m, however, has only come recently; and Muslims are often unsettled and "offended" (i.e. make death threats) when fundamental questions about the historical Mu&#x1e25;ammad get asked.  Not only do we get proposals that Mu&#x1e25;ammad didn't exist but also strange assertions such as that the <I>Qur'&acirc;n</I> was originally in Aramaic and was patched together over many years.

<P>A moderate and sober version of this revisionism can be found with <I>In the Shadow of the Sword, The Birth of Islam and the Rise of the Global Arab Empire</I>, by Tom Holland [Anchor Books, 2012, 2013].  The salient issue in this book is whether Mu&#x1e25;ammad actually came from Mecca.  The arguments, largely from the internal evidence of the <I>Qur'&acirc;n</I> itself, seem quite strong, but with one fatal flaw.  If Mu&#x1e25;ammad was not from Mecca, but from some locale rather further north, where was that?  There is not a clue about a specific location, and never even a speculative suggestion from Holland.  Yet if Mu&#x1e25;ammad seems to have been involved in active international trade, as we are given to understand, and if he achieved enough fame to be invited to rule Yathrib, as he was, it is hard to understand how the center of his early activities would never get mentioned.  If one objection against Mecca is that there is really little notice of the place in the <I>Qur'&acirc;n</I>, this same objection applies even more strongly to a place that, as it happens, is not mentioned at all.  And if another objection to Mecca is that it is never mentioned by non-Isl&acirc;mic sources, then, again, this applies equally well to the place that the <I>Qur'an</I> does mention as the site of the <B>Ka'aba</B>, namely "Bakka," which itself otherwise cannot be identified from any other source whatsoever.

<P>So, while it is edifying that Isl&acirc;m should receive the same kind of critical attention that Judaism and Christianity have endured, it is not clear that this really adds up to much.  We may have questions, but clear and decisive answers are elusive, and the forms of revisionism, radical or moderate, are left with incomplete cases.  A mature and confident Isl&acirc;m could shrug off such things, as Christians must the constant assaults of <a href="atheism.htm">atheists</a>; but it is obviously a condition of our times that Muslims often react with fury and violence to skepticism, whether innocent, perceptive, or foolish.  Until Muslims get a grip, "<a href="#phobia">Islamophobia</a>," as <I>fear</I> of Isl&acirc;m, will be fully justified.

<P>The Isl&acirc;mic Era accompanies the Isl&acirc;mic <a href="numbers.htm#islam">Calendar</a>, which is purely lunar and cycles through the seasons every 32 or 33 years, a convenient provision when fasting is required during the daylight hours in the month of Rama&#x1e0d;&acirc;n -- neither Northern nor Southern hemispheres are stuck with Rama&#x1e0d;&acirc;n at times of either long or short days.  Curiously, the 30 year cycle of the Isl&acirc;mic calendar <a href="calendar.htm#nabo">commensurates</a> with the 19 year cycle of the Jewish <a href="calendar.htm#jewish">calendar</a> after 1368 solar or 1410 lunar Isl&acirc;mic years.  This puts the Isl&acirc;mic Era in 622 at one full cycle after the beginning of the <a href="calendar.htm">Era of Nabonassar</a> in 747 BC.  Another full cycle comes down to our time, in 1990.  Anyone disposed to numerological portents are welcome to make of this what they will.<br clear=right>

With the death of the Prophet, some Arabs thought that the House of Isl&acirc;m had ended.  They were soon persuaded of the error of their ways, and the armies of united Arabia were turned on Romania and Persia, which were both exhausted from the longest and harshest war they had ever fought against each other.  The Roman position in Syria and Egypt was also compromised by the Monophysite heresy of the locals, and its suppression by Imperial authorities.<br clear=right><img src="images/maps/islam-03.gif" align=right>  The tolerance of the Arabs for any "People of the Book" seemed preferable, especially after the respect and consideration shown by the Caliph 'Umar when he entered Jersualem.  The period of the "Rightly Guided Caliphs," who were all either fathers-in-law or sons-in-law of Mu&#x1e25;ammad, however, ended in some confusion.  The murder of 'Uthman was blamed by his powerful Meccan relatives on 'Al&icirc;, who was unable to exert authority against them over all Isl&acirc;mic territories.  The "bloody shirt of 'Uthman" was thereafter considered a largely cynical ploy by the Omayyads to further their own cause, which soon did triumph at the death of 'Al&icirc;, whose sons were either bought off (&#x1e24;asan) or killed (&#x1e24;usayn).<br clear=left>

<P><a name="heirs">Although the Omayyads were cousins of Mu&#x1e25;ammad, they definitely had the greater status at Mecca and were originally quite hostile (except for 'Uthman) to Isl&acirc;m.  The symbolic crowns in the diagram are for the Prophet and the Caliphs (<img src="images/greek/caliph.gif" align=middle>, <I>Khal&icirc;fah</I>, "successor").  Only that for the Prophet is given with a nimbus, since for the Orthodox only he was divinely inspired and authoritative.  <img src="history/islam-01.gif" align=left>The light blue nimbus for 'Al&icirc; indicates the Shi'ite belief that he and his descendants were divinely inspired and authoritative also (the <I>Im&acirc;ms</I>).  Modern families that trace descent to the Prophet or his family, like <a href="#hashem">Kings</a> of Hijaz, Iraq, and Jordan, call themselves H&acirc;shemites.

<P>A curious feature of the genealogical diagram is the presence of an <I>adopted</I> son of Mu&#x1e25;ammad.  This is Zayd, the only living person besides Mu&#x1e25;ammad himself named in the Qur'&acirc;n (33:37) and the first male to convert to Islam.  If Zayd had lived, and his status affirmed, not only would he have been the obvious heir and successor to Mu&#x1e25;ammad, but it is conceivable that he might have inherited the full mantle of prophecy from him.  Instread, Zayd was killed in battle and predeceased Mu&#x1e25;ammad, leaving only a minor son, 'Us&acirc;mah.  And the doctrine became accepted that prophecy ceased with Mu&#x1e25;ammad, the "Seal" of the prophets.  Isl&acirc;mic tradition is that Zayd had actually been "unadopted," with verses in the Qur'&acirc;n explicitly abolishing adoption altogether and denying that Mu&#x1e25;ammad was the father of anyone (Sura 33:4,40).  However, when Mu&#x1e25;ammad triumphantly entered Mecca, 'Us&acirc;mah rode behind him, in a position reserved for his heir.  And when the Prophet lay dying, and 'Us&acirc;mah arrived, Mu&#x1e25;ammad, no longer able to speak, placed his hand on the 17 year-old boy's head, in a gesture that could well have been a conferral of authority.  Instead, the boy was pushed aside by the older Companions.  When an edition of the Qur'&acirc;n was redacted by the Omayad Caliph 'Abd'al-Malid, there is some suspicion that the verses were introduced to discredit the line of Zayd and eliminate the family of 'Us&acirc;mah as a threat to the Throne.  The Shi'ites had no reason to complain about this.  And thus, if there had been a Party of Zayd and 'Us&acirc;ma, it entirely lost its place in history.  'Us&acirc;ma himself lived out his life, with heirs, but had been retired to a quiet life in Medina, like 'Al&icirc;'s son &#x1e24;asan.<br clear=left>

Soon, he and his successors were also believed to have a unique divinely inspired understanding of the meaning of the Qur'&acirc;n.  Thus, the Sh&icirc;'ite office of <img src="images/greek/imam.gif" align=middle>, <B>Im&acirc;m</B>, became a source of doctrinal authority such as was missing from Orthodox Isl&acirc;m, which relied on tradition and consensus to establish Isl&acirc;mic law and doctrine.  The line of Im&acirc;ms splits, however, when the Seventh, Ism&acirc;'&icirc;l, is rejected by much of the community.  The Seveners, nevertheless, had the most spectacular successes of Sh&icirc;'ism in the Middle Ages.  Today, the Agha Khan heads a Sevener community in India.  The collateral line ended with the Twelfth Im&acirc;m, who disappeared in 878.  Although probably kidnapped and murdered by the Abbasid Caliph, he was believed by his followers to have gone into deathless "Occultation," preparing to return as the "Rightly Guided One," the <img src="images/greek/mahdi.gif" align=middle>, <I>Mahd&icirc;</I>, to usher in the Apocalypse.  In time, this Twelver Sh&icirc;'ism was used by the <a href="iran.htm#safavid">Safavids</a> to establish a durable national monarchy in Ir&acirc;n.  In 1848, it had been 1000 Isl&acirc;mic <a href="calendar.htm#nabo">lunar years</a> since the Occultation, and the return of the Hidden Im&acirc;m was widely expected.  Various figures appeared as the Im&acirc;m, including the <img src="images/greek/bab.gif" align=middle>, <I>B&acirc;b</I> ("Gate"), from whom the <B>B&acirc;b&icirc;</B> and <a href="http://www.bahai.org/"><B>Bah&acirc;'&icirc;</B></a> faiths derive.

The <B>Ayatoll&acirc;h Khomeini</B> was able to use his position to overthrow the last <a href="iran.htm#pahlavi">Sh&acirc;h</a> in 1979 and establish a theocratic "Isl&acirc;mic Republic."<br clear=right>

Under the Omayyads the House of Isl&acirc;m was undoubtedly an Arab Empire, with only a very secondary interest in winning converts to the Faith.  Indeed, many Arabs believed that Mu&#x1e25;ammad had simply been a Prophet for the Arabs, as Moses had been the Prophet for the Israelites, and this view was reflected in the practice that newly converted Moslems needed to be affiliated with an Arab tribe.  Despite the seemingly half-hearted religious mission, the zeal of the Arab armies nevertheless permanently altered the linguistic and religious map of lands from the Hindu Kush to the Atlantic.  Of the major territories won in this period, only Spain would later return to Christendom, while in our own time a precarious Jewish state has been established in Palestine.  The principal disappointment, the failure to take Constantinople and overthrow Romania, had to wait 800 years for the <a href="turkia.htm#turks">Ottomans</a>.

<P>The high water mark of the Omayyad realm was certainly under 'Abd al-Malik and al-Wal&icirc;d, as North Africa, Spain, Transoxania, and part of the Indus Valley fell to Isl&acirc;m.  Permanent monuments to the period were 'Abd al-Malik's Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem and al-Wal&icirc;d's Omayyad Mosque in Damascus.  Since both these buildings are now some 1300 years old, it is an oversight of many treatments of history that they are not more celebrated as monuments from a period that is otherwise considered an obscure part of the "Dark Ages."  Never before had Damascus been, and never again would it be, the center of such power and civilization.

</table>

In time, hostility against the Omayyads began to mount.  The resentment of the non-Arabic second-class Moslems joined with the cause of the partisans of 'Al&icirc;, questioning the legitimacy of the regime and agitating against it.  Also, later Omayyads sometimes seemed insufficiently interested in Isl&acirc;m.  Desert hunting lodges contained images much more Roman than Arab in inspiration, and one Caliph is supposed to have shot a copy of the Qur'&acirc;n to pieces out of resentment for its prohibition of wine.

<P>When the storm broke, it was with astonishing ferocity.  The entire Omayyad clan was exterminated.  Only one prince escaped, to <a href="#spain">Spain</a>, where an Omayyad regime endured.  Elsewhere, the rebellion succeeded completely, bringing to power distant cousins of the Omayyads, the descendants of Mu&#x1e25;ammad's uncle 'Abb&acirc;s.

<P>All Moslems now became (more or less) equal, and when the capital shifted to Baghbad, the influence of Persian civilization began to predominate over Roman.  The Arabs lost their preeminence, and soon it was the rare Caliph who was not the child of a Persian or Turkish mother.  As the Abbasids later declined, Arabia itself slipped from their hold, to become once again a political, if not a religious, backwater.  The Arabs had bestowed their religion and their language on the civilization of the Middle East, but true Arabian Arabs would be politically insignificant until the discovery of oil in the 20th century gave them a geopolitical status beyond what any other asset would warrant.

<P><a name="paper">The defeat of the Chinese at Talas was probably still a function of the momentum of Omayyad conquest.  However, the overthrow of the Omayyads immediately deflated this momentum, and no further advantage was taken of the Chinese embarrassment -- at a time when the <a href="sangoku.htm#t'ang">T'ang Dynasty</a> had seen its best days and was on the verge of decline.  Curiously, there seems to have been one long-term consequence of the battle of a very different sort.  Reportedly, among the Chinese prisoners taken at Talas were artisans who knew how to make <a href="sangoku.htm#paper">paper</a>.  What they were doing with a Chinese army in Central Asia, I don't know; but the significance of their craft was quickly recognized.  Soon, the <a href="#paper2">Abbasids</a> founded paper mills in Baghdad and the industry quickly spread to <a href="romania.htm#amor">Romania</a>.  Since <a href="hist-1.htm#pergamum">parchment</a> is more durable than paper, surviving books tend to be in that material; and the role of paper books in the Mediaeval book market is thus a matter of some uncertainty.  That they existed, however, at least in Islam and Romania, is beyond doubt.  Paper mills in <a href="francia.htm">Francia</a> are first attested in <a href="perifran.htm#spain">Arag&oacute;n</a> in 1282.

<P><a name="titles">The Arabic title <img src="images/greek/amir.gif" align=middle>, <I>am&icirc;r</I>, is important.  Originally this just means "commander" and would be used for a general military officer, or even for the Caliph himself, the <img src="images/greek/believrs.gif" align=middle><img src="images/greek/amir.gif" align=middle>, <I>Am&icirc;ru 'lMu'min&icirc;n</I>, "Commander of the Faithful."  The military commanders then become governors, and so <I>am&icirc;r</I> comes to mean "governor."  The governors then drift into independence, and <I>am&icirc;r</I> then can reasonably be translated "prince."  The first truly independent Amirs were the Omayyads in <a href="#spain">Spain</a>, who were content with the title for a century and a half.  Later many Abbasid governors drifted into independence, and the "Emirate" becomes the basic domain of independent Isl&acirc;mic statehood.

<P>A title that is mostly <I>not</I> seen for many centuries is <img src="images/greek/malik.gif" align=middle>, <I>malik</I>, "king."  This is not really an Isl&acirc;mic title of rule, though it can be a proper name and is very close to one of the Names of God, <img src="images/greek/maalik.gif" align=middle>, <I>M&acirc;lik</I>, "Owner, Master, Possessor."  <a name="omgen"><img src="history/islam-03.gif" align=right>Every day, Muslims invoke God as the <img src="images/greek/ad-din.gif" align=middle><img src="images/greek/yaum.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/maalik.gif" align=middle>, <I>M&acirc;liku Yaumi dD&icirc;ni</I>, "Possessor the of the Day of Judgment" (S&ucirc;rah 1:4).  <I>Malik</I> has largely been a <a href="#hashem">post-colonial</a> title, often an ephemeral one.

<P>The old Persian word for King, however, <img src="images/greek/shah.gif" align=middle>, <I>Sh&acirc;h</I>, occurred with some frequently in <a href="iran.htm#iran">Iran</a> and <a href="sangoku.htm#delhi">India</a>.  What becomes the classic Isl&acirc;mic title of rule, <img src="images/greek/sultan.gif" align=middle>, <I>Sul&#x1e6d;&acirc;n</I>, "Power, Dominion, Authority," the equivalent in significance and ideology, of universal secular rule, begins with the <a href="#manz">Seljuks</a>.  Its effective universality, however, is shortlived.

<P><a name="sahib">Meanwhile, we see a title used for the Roman Emperor in Constantinople.  The Arab historian a&#x6d;-&#x1e6c;abar&icirc; (in his <I>Annales</I>, edition in Leiden, 1883-1884) relates details of embassies in 845 between the <a href="#abbas">Abbasid</a> Caliph al-W&acirc;thiq (842-847) and the <a href="romania.htm#amor">Amorian</a> Emperor Michael III (842-867) -- or his Regent mother, Theodora (842-856) -- about a prisoner exchange.

<P>The Caliph had been executing prisoners, taken in the sack of Amoricum in 838, when they refused to convert to Isl&acirc;m.  Since the Romans had their own Arab prisoners, an exchange was suggested, and accepted.

<P>The Roman ambassadors are called <img src="images/greek/arrum-w.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/sahibi.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/rusulu.gif" align=middle>, <I>rusulu &#x1e62;&acirc;&#x1e25;ibi-r-R&ucirc;m</I>, the "messengers of the Emperor of the Romans," one of whom seems to have been the future Patriarch <a href="romania.htm#photius">Photius</a>.  See the <a href="decdenc1.htm#note-8">discussion</a> of the expression for "Romans."

<P>So here the word for "Emperor" is <img src="images/greek/sahib.gif" align=middle> (irregular or "broken" plural <img src="images/greek/sahibs.gif" align=middle>, <I>&#x1e63;a&#x1e25;&acirc;bah</I>), which is familiar, as "Sahib," in countless movies about India and Africa.  It is an important word in Arabic.  <I>&#x1e62;&acirc;&#x1e25;ib</I> can mean "owner, possessor, master, lord," etc., as it does here, or it can mean "companion, comrade, friend, follower" (<I>comes</I> in Latin).  Thus, <img src="images/greek/assahibs.gif" align=middle>, <I>a&#x1e63;-&#x1e62;a&#x1e25;&acirc;bah</I>, are the "Companions" of the Prophet Mu&#x1e25;ammad.  These are the most important personages in the history of Isl&acirc;m apart from the Prophet himself.  Also noteworthy is the term <img src="images/greek/rusul.gif" align=middle>, "messengers," where the singular, <img src="images/greek/rasul.gif" align=middle>, <I>ras&ucirc;l</I>, is found in the expression <img src="images/greek/allah-w.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/rasulu.gif" align=middle>, <I>ras&ucirc;lu-ll&acirc;h</I>, i.e. Mu&#x1e25;ammad as the "Messenger of God," which is used in the Confession of Faith.

Military expansion of the Caliphate ceased under the Abbasids.  Instead there soon was, in effect, a turning inward and an examination and definition of what Isl&acirc;m and Isl&acirc;mic civilization were going to mean, especially in relation to the rival religions and the heritage of Classical civilization.  Thus, we find the beginning of <a href="hist-1.htm#islam">philosophy in Isl&acirc;m</a>, especially when al-Ma'm&ucirc;n creates the <I>D&acirc;ru-l&#x1e24;ikmah</I>, the "House of Wisdom," principally to translate Greek texts into Arabic.  This gives rise to the Hellenizing tradition of <I>falsafah</I>, <img src="images/greek/falsafah.gif">.  On the other hand, we also get the independent, or antagonistic, development of Islamic theology, or <I>Kal&acirc;m</I>, <img src="images/greek/kalam.gif" align=middle> ("Talk") -- which often displays more original ideas than the strictly philosophical tradition.

<P>The height of the Abbasid period in legendary hindsight is the reign of H&acirc;r&ucirc;n arRash&icirc;d.  There are several stories about him in the (Book of) <I>One Thousand and One Nights</I> (<I>Kit&acirc;b Alf Layla waLayla</I>, <img src="images/greek/layla.gif" align=middle><img src="images/greek/wa.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/layla.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/alf.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/kitab.gif" align=middle>), often with him visiting the public <I>incognito</I>.  It is hard to know how much of a historical basis there is for most of those stories.  It does lend, however, a magical air to the early culture of Baghd&acirc;d.  The collection of stories itself seems to date in a definitely form from <a href="#mamluk">Maml&ucirc;k</a> Egypt.

<P><a name="paper2">As noted <a href="#paper">above</a>, Chinese artisans with knowledge of paper making are supposed to have been captured in 751.  They were first put to work making paper in nearby Samarkand.  By 794-795, the Waz&icirc;r of H&acirc;r&ucirc;n arRash&icirc;d, Jafar al-Barmak, founded a paper mill in Baghbad.  The relative cheapness and convenience of paper over the alternatives (<a href="hist-1.htm#pergamum">parchment</a>, papyrus, stone, clay, bone, shells, ostraca) transformed literate culture, with the drawback, however, that the medium, like papyrus, is less durable than parchment, let alone stone or ostraca.  The technology was soon exported to <a href="romania.htm#amor">Romania</a>, where we get notable developments in the literate culture of the 9th century, such as the introduction of "miniscule" script and punctuation -- things that are often noted as features of the <a href="francia.htm#caroling">Carolingian</a> "Renaissance" but certainly derive from the innovations apparent in Islam and Romania.

<P>Politically, the Abbasid era then becomes a story of fragmentation, as governors become autonomous and then rival powers arise.  At first, only Spain escaped the Abbasid revolution.

After the Abbasid overthrow and massacre of the Omayyads, <a href="perifran.htm#spain">Spain</a> was a place where their authority was never asserted.  Instead, the Omayyad prince 'Abd-urRa&#x1e25;m&acirc;n, escaping the massacre, established himself and his line.  Isl&acirc;m had little trouble in Spain these days.  <a href="francia.htm#caroling">Charlemagne</a> pushed the Omayyads back from the Pyrenees and established the Marches there that grew into later kingdoms, but he was defeated at Roncesvalles in 778 and the heart of Spain was little effected.  Eventually, in response to the <a href="#fatimid">Fatimid Shi'ite Caliphate</a>, the Spanish Omayyads proclaimed their own Caliphate.

Egypt first drifted out of Abbasid control under its originally faithful &#x1e6c;&ucirc;l&ucirc;nid governors, while the Caliphate was distracted by the Zanj Rebellion.  A&#x1e25;mad built one of the oldest monuments in Cairo (at the time still called Fus&#x6d;&acirc;&#x6d;), the <B>Ibn &#x1e6c;&ucirc;l&ucirc;n Mosque</B>.  The dynasty fell victim to the brief revival of Abbasid power at the beginning of the 10th century.

<P><a name="zanj">The <B>Zanj Rebellion</B> (869-883) was a lengthy and terrifying business, which at one point threatened the existence of the Caliphate.  "Zanj," <img src="images/greek/zanj.gif" align=middle>, is a name for East Africa and for the black slaves taken from there, by capture or purchase.  Thus, the slaves, or the people, could be either  <img src="images/greek/zanj-al.gif" align=middle>, <I>az-Zanj</I>, or <img src="images/greek/zunuj.gif" align=middle>, <I>Zun&ucirc;j</I> (an irregular or "broken" plural).  An individual of the kind is a <img src="images/greek/zanji.gif" align=middle>, <I>Zanj&icirc;</I>.  "Zanj" seems to be preserved in the Arabic name of <a href="#oman">Zanzibar</a>, <img src="images/greek/zanzibar.gif" align=middle>, <I>Zanjab&acirc;r</I>, which contained a great slave market and was the source of slaving expeditions into the interior -- right down to the 19th century, when the British, of course, stopped the slave trade and made Zanzibar a Protectorate in 1890.

<P>The Zanj Rebellion against the Abbasids began with escaped African slaves, who had sought refuge in the marshlands of southern Iraq (as slaves in America could find refuge in the everglades of Florida among the Seminole Indians, who also fought their own wars, 1816–1819, 1835–1842, & 1855–1858).  They were joined by other (white) slaves and, apparently, people who were just brigands.  Some scholarly opinion questions whether African slaves were predominant, or even present at all.  The testimony of Arab historians apparently isn't enough to overcome the squeamishness of modern historians to admit that Isl&acirc;m enslaved and ferociously treated black Africans (something that, to ignorant or dishonest politically correct opinion, has only ever been done by <a href="racism.htm">racist</a> Europeans), who in this case rose up with a force that made the rebellion of Nat Turner (1831) look like a strongly worded letter to the editor.  At one point the Zanj actually captured and looted the major city of Basra and advanced to within 50 miles of Baghdad.  Vast slaughter attended suppressing the Zanj -- Mas'&ucirc;d&icirc; (<I>c.</I>896–956) says 500,000 dead in the whole rebellion.  Larger numbers were suggested by other sources.<br clear=right>

<P>Although Orthodox, the &#x1e62;aff&acirc;rids rejected the need for recognition by the Caliphal authority -- but the second amir was eventually recognized as governor of several Ir&acirc;nian provinces.  &#x1e62;aff&acirc;rid power, however, was soon checked by the S&acirc;man&icirc;ds, who themselves claimed descent from the <a href="iran.htm#shahs">Sassanid</a> Sh&acirc;hs and patronized the revival of Persian as a literary language in the epic of Firdaws&icirc; (940-1020), the <B>Sh&acirc;h-n&acirc;ma</B> (<I>Book of Kings</I> -- <I>n&acirc;ma</I> is today used to mean "letter" or "paper," while Arabic <I>kit&acirc;b</I> is used for "book").  This is now regarded as the Ir&acirc;nian National Epic and is noteworthy for the dignity accorded to Zoroaster as a Prophet of God.

<P><img src="images/zoroast2.gif" align=right>The book contains a striking dream image, of four men pulling at the corners of a square cloth, but not tearing it.  This is interpreted to mean that the four men are the Prophets Moses, Zoroaster, Jesus, and Mu&#x1e25;ammad, while the cloth is the Religion of God.  That Zoroaster figures along with Moses, Jesus, and Mu&#x1e25;ammad is an unmistakable clue that we are dealing with a Persian source.  Otherwise, Muslims do not go out of their way to include Zoroaster, certainly not on equal footing, with the other three -- the <I>Qur'&acirc;n</I> mentions the "Magians," <img src="images/greek/majus.gif" align=middle>, <I>al-Maj&ucirc;s</I> [22:17], but <I>not</I> among the tolerated "People of the Book."  Also, as a statement about religion it is un-Isl&acirc;mic and subversive in that it implies an equality, despite the conflict, between the four attendant religions.  The Isl&acirc;mic view is that only Mu&#x1e25;ammad delivers an uncorrupted revelation, with his definitive version replacing that of the earlier prophets -- who in turn are accused of "corrupting" their own scriptures.  Nevertheless, the origin of Isl&acirc;mic Law in Abbasid Iraq seems to have involved many Persian converts, whose influence may be evident in provisions such as for a Zoroastrian practice of five prayers a day, where the <I>Qur'&acirc;n</I> only specifies three, and for the execution of apostates.

<P>Both the &#x1e62;aff&acirc;rids and S&acirc;man&icirc;ds eventually fell to the coming wave of Turkish regimes.  The S&acirc;m&acirc;nids were thus the last Ir&acirc;nian domain in Transoxania, which in short order will merit the name "Turkestan."

The defeat of the Zanj seems to have allowed a revival of Abbasid power, which again spread as far as Egypt.  But then the old inertia took over again, and the Caliphs again lost their grip, soon to be under the thumb of the Buwayids.  Meanwhile, in Egypt, the Ikhsh&icirc;dids began the process of drifting out of Abbasid control but then found themselves trying to stop the triumphant Fatimids, ultimately unsuccessfully.<br clear=right>

As the Ikhsh&icirc;dids drifted out of Abbasid control, Northern Syria broke away from them, beginning an era of considerable fragmentation.  Sayf-udDawla ("Sword of the State") became a celebrated foe of <a href="romania.htm#macedon">Romania</a>, but he was largely unsuccessful against the revival of Roman power, and his son experienced devastating defeats, at one point with Aleppo and &#x1e24;oms themselves falling, though retained with the payment of tribute.  As the Abbasids declined, Romania revived, recovered lost territory, like Antioch, evicted Muslims, and established a regional hegemony.  Only the arrival of the Seljuk Turks reversed fortunes again.

<P>The Buwayids were Shi'ite Princes who dominated the Abbasid Caliphs for a century.  Although they fostered a flourishing of Shi'ite scholarship and theology, they never tried to suppress the Orthodox Caliphs altogether, so the Abbasids continued to exercise their minimal religious authority under the regime.  Nevertheless, the Caliphs and the Orthodox were not too happy about this and so, at least initially, welcomed the coming of the Orthodox Seljuks.  The appeal of Shi'ism in Ir&acirc;n, evident here, later becomes the basis of Ir&acirc;nian nationalism in the <a href="iran.htm#safavid">Safavids</a>.  This is the nadir of the Abbasid Caliphate, with its secular power and prestige completely eclipsed.

<P>The origin of the name of <B>Baghd&acirc;d</B>, <img src="images/greek/baghdad.gif" align=middle>, is itself obscure.  The <I>d&acirc;d</I> element looks like it is from the Indo-European verb "give," which we also see in Persian names like <I>Mehrd&acirc;d</I>, "given by Mithra."  <img src="images/maps/mes-caps.gif" align=right>With the first element, it could be Middle Persian "god," <I>bag</I> (Sanskrit <I>bhaga</I>), or Middle Persian "garden," <I>b&acirc;gh</I> (also <I>b&acirc;gh</I> in Punjabi, which looks like a borrowing from Persian -- the "gh" is not a voiced aspirate stop, as in <a href="cognates.htm#sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> or Hindi, but the fricative that is indicated, but not always pronounced, in Indian, i.e. <a href="upan.htm#note-0">Hindi and Urdu</a>, borrowings from Persian or Arabic).  My guess is that "garden" is more likely right, so that the meaning is probably "a garden is given," rather than "given by God."  But this can still leave us wondering whether the name already belonge to the site, and what it was about the site that appealed to the Abbasid builders.  Ctesiphon is not far down the river, closer than Samarra is up river.<br clear=right>

The complete genealogy of the Alids, Omayyads, and Abbasids is in <I>The Cambridge History of Islam</I>, Volume 1B, [edited by P.M. Holt, Ann K.S. Lambton, & Bernard Lewis, Cambridge University Press, 1970, pp.731-733].  Unfortunately, the diagrams contain no dates.  Much the same information, with dates, is in <I>The Arabs</I> by Anthony Nutting [Mentor Books, 1964, p.202-203].  I have not found a complete genealogy of the <a href="#mamluk">Egyptian Abbasids</a>.  According to Bosworth's <I>The New Islamic Dynasties</I> [pp.7 & 9], the relationship of the two lines is uncertain anyway.  Now, however, I have received from Derek Whaley a genealogy of the Egyptian Abbasids which he has assembled, with a connection to the main Abbasid line.  Much of this can be confirmed in Bosworth, and I provide it, with a couple of additions and corrections, here, formerly just in a <a href="javascript:popup('history/islam-06.gif','abegypt','resizable,scrollbars,width=540,height=609')" onMouseover="window.status='Click for genealogy of Egyptian Abbasids popup';return true" onMouseout="window.status='';return true">popup</a>, but now connected up with the rest of the Abbasids.

<P>While the <a href="#manz">Seljuks</a> rescued the Abbasids from the Buwayids, this meant nothing like the restoration of Abbasid power.  Autonomy, at least, was restored in 1194 as the Seljuks passed into their own decline, but freedom for the Caliphs would be short lived.  The next invaders, the <a href="mongol.htm#ilkhan">Mongols</a>, had not (yet) converted to Isl&acirc;m and had no respect or interest for the Abbasids.  The wife of the Khan H&uuml;leg&uuml; was reportedly a <a href="popes.htm#east">Nestorian</a> Christian, who advised killing the Caliph.  Warned the calamities would follow if the Caliph's blood touched the ground, in 1258 H&uuml;leg&uuml; had al-Musta'&#x1e63;im beaten to death in a sack.  After all the glories and romance of the Abbasid Caliphate, this was a particularly sad, ignominous, and humiliating end.  It seemed like a body blow to Isl&acirc;m, which had lost its institutional and genetic continuity to the Prophet himself.  Baghdad would not even be a capital city again until the British carved modern <a href="#iraq">Iraq</a> out of the Ottoman Empire, even as the previous prosperity of the country fell into neglected ruin, perhaps for the first time since the <a href="notes/oldking.htm#sumer">Sumerians</a>.

<P>But the <a href="#mamluk">Maml&ucirc;ks</a>, after a fashion, came to the rescue of the Abbasids.  They reckoned that a figurehead Caliph in Cairo could be useful, as it would be.  So an Abbasid cousin was recruited; and, after a while, his position even became accepted as legitimate.  Even the <a href="turkia.htm">Ottomans</a> sought diplomas of political authority and titles from the Caliph.  But eventually the Ottomans showed up in person, and Selim "the Grim" overthrew the Maml&ucirc;ks and annexed Egypt.  The last, the very last, Abbasid Caliph, al-Mutawakkil III, was shipped off to Constantinople.

<P>There is no reason why the Abbasid line should not have continued in Constantinople, as figureheads for the Ottomans, as they had been for the Maml&ucirc;ks, but instead they disappear from history.  I do not know whether they died out, the Ottomans exterminated them, or they just disappeared into obscurity.

<P>That the Ottoman Sul&#x1e6d;&acirc;ns somehow were their annointed successors is the claim they made much later, whose mysterious origin and baseless audacity is only matched by its remarkable acceptance among Orthodox Muslims.  When the title and office were abolished by <a href="turkia.htm#republic">Kemal Atat&uuml;rk</a> in 1924, we then have the equally puzzling <I>lack</I> of interest in the attempt to claim it by <a href="#hashem">Hussein</a> of Mecca, whose descent from the Prophet was otherwise acknowledged.  Meanwhile, as Muslims in India had been accusing the British of undermining the Ottoman Caliph, perhaps because of the Allied <a href="turkia.htm#occupation">occupation</a> of Constantinople, Atat&uuml;rk suddenly took all the wind out of their sails.  The British had nothing to do with it.

<hr>

<P>Below we see Isl&acirc;m in the year 1000 AD.  The days of secular authority of the Abbasid Caliphs are now gone.  The Caliphs are dominated by the Buwayid princes.  The center of Islamic power and culture has moved to Egypt, with the Caliphate of the Shi'ite <a href="#fatimid">Fatimids</a>.  The Fatimids even control the sacred cities of Mecca and Medina.  Representing Orthodoxy, the Omayyads in Spain have also declared a Caliphate.  In the East, we see the fateful advent of the Turks, with the <a href="#ghazna">Ghaznawids</a> beginning their inroads into India.  This will permanently introduce Islam into India, even as these Turkish states mean the disappearance of Iranian people from Central Asia and the penetration of Turkish peoples deep into Iran and ultimately Anatolia, whose <a href="turkia.htm">modern name</a> becomes the eponym of the whole people.<br clear=right>

The glorious culmination of Omayyad rule in Spain comes when 'AbdurRa&#x1e25;m&acirc;n III proclaims himself Caliph.  One reason that he may have done so, besides the general decline of the Abbasids in power the prestige, was the new <a href="#fatimid">Fatimid Caliphate</a> in North Africa.  However, this epochal elevation of the Omayyads to the status they previously had enjoyed in <a href="#siege-1">Damascus</a> ends up leading to a surprisingly rapid collapse of the regime.  'AbdurRa&#x1e25;m&acirc;n's great grandchildren became the pawns of slave troups from Europe (the <I>&#x1e62;aq&acirc;liba</I>) and North Africa.  <img src="images/maps/taifas.gif" align=right>Leadership devolved onto the <I>&#x1e24;&acirc;jib</I> or Chief Minister, like Ibn Ab&icirc; 'Amir Al-Man&#x1e63;&ucirc;r (Almanzor), who scored one of the great successes of Islamic Spain by capturing Barcelona and sacking the shrine of St. James of Compostella (<I>Santiago</I> -- later in the battle cry of <a href="perifran.htm#text">Spanish</a> armies, <I>Santiago y Espa&ntilde;a</I>) in Galicia, hitherto the most sacred site of Christian Spain.  But from this pinnacle of triumph against Christendom, the situation soon, very soon, escaped even this kind of control.  Isl&acirc;mic Spain broke into petty states and permanently lost its ability to maintain its own unity or resist the <a href="perifran.htm#table">Christian</a> <I>Reconquista</I>.

<P>Note that the <a href="#omgen">genealogy</a> of the Omayyads here is included with that of the original Caliphate.<br clear=right>

Omayyad Spain broke up into a chaos of petty states, like the period of the <a href="mongol.htm#oghullar"><I>Oghullar</I></a> in Anatolia.  In Arabic, the rulers were called the <img src="images/greek/attawaif.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/muluk.gif" align=middle>, <I>mul&ucirc;k a&#x6d;-&#x1e6c;aw&acirc;'if</I>, or the "kings of the bands/factions/parties [singular <img src="images/greek/taifah.gif" align=middle>, <I>&#x6d;&acirc;'ifa</I>]."  This was adapted into Spanish as the <B><I>Reyes de Taifas</I></B>.

<P>The map above shows 21 <I>Reyes de Taifas</I> in 1030, but at different times there were up to 39 of them.  Only some of the more significant and durable are listed in the tables here.  Already, both Le&oacute;n and Navarre are larger than any Islamic state.  Spain would never again be unified by a native Islamic state.  This disunity was, of course, a golden opportunity for the Christian kingdoms; and the fall of Toledo to <a href="perifran.htm#zallaqa">Le&oacute;n and Castille</a> in 1085 is significantly considered the beginning of the Christian <I>Reconquista</I>.  The Moslem position was restored by the advent of the Almoravids, who then absorbed all the Taifa states.  Toledo, however, which had been the capital of the <a href="germania.htm#visigoths">Visigoths</a> and was still considered the heart of Spain, was never recovered.<br clear=right>

The <B>Mur&acirc;bi&#x6d;&ucirc;n</B>, or Spanish <I>Almor&aacute;vides</I>, began as a Berber religious movement, named after a <I>rib&acirc;&#x6d;</I> or "hermitage" at the mouth of the Senegal River from which, perhaps spuriously, its militants originally derived.  Be that as it may, the movement began with a local chief, Ya&#x1e25;y&acirc; ibn Ibr&acirc;h&icirc;m, who returned from Mecca with a Moroccan scholar, 'Abdall&acirc;h ibn Y&acirc;s&icirc;n, both ready to fire up a rivalist and militant movement.  The warriors moved north, under multiple leadership.  Since they wore veils, as do the Tuaregs today, they are also known as the <I>mutalaththim&ucirc;n</I>, "veiled ones."  A state was founded in Morocco and Algeria by Y&ucirc;suf ibn T&acirc;shuf&icirc;n, who established himself at a new capital, Marrakech.  Intervention in Spain followed shortly (1086), largely restoring the Isl&acirc;mic position there.  The Almoravids were Orthodox and acknowledged the Abbasid Caliph.  They ended up getting overwhelmed by a new religious movement, less conservative, the <a href="#muwah">Almohads</a>.<br clear=right>

After the <a href="#spain">Omayads</a> prevented the imposition of Abbasid authority in Spain, the first territories to be wholly alienated from the Caliphate were in North Africa -- the <B>Maghrib</B>, the "West."  This was mostly a matter of heterodoxy.  The Rustamids were Kh&acirc;rijites.  In the East the Kh&acirc;rijites had been a violent and revolutionary heresy, denying that those who violated the moral strictures of Isl&acirc;m were even Muslims.  In the East, they were suppressed amid great slaughter.  In North Africa, the sect finds a nationalistic base among the Berbers, creating a mass movement, beginning with the Rustamids, such as didn't exist in the East.

<P>In Morocco, under Idr&icirc;s I ibn 'Abdall&acirc;h, a great-grandson of &#x1e24;asan, the son of <a href="#imams">'Al&icirc;</a>, we get another movement.  With his background, it is perhaps not surprising that Idr&icirc;s both claimed the Caliphate and established Shi'ism.  He also founded the Mad&icirc;nat F&acirc;s, the city of Fez.  Eventually the Idr&icirc;sids fragmented and then fell to the Fatimids, who inherited the mantle of the Shi'ite Caliphate.  Years later, an Idr&icirc;sid branch, the <a href="#taifa-5">&#x1e24;amm&ucirc;dids</a> became one of the <I>Reyes de Taifas</I> of Spain.

<P>The other two North African dynasties given here (perhaps a bit out of sequence) were successors to the Fatimids.  These began with Z&icirc;ri ibn Man&acirc;d, a Berber retainer of the Fatimids.  The succession of the Zirids is given <a href="#zirid">below</a>.  Z&icirc;ri's son, Bulugg&icirc;n, was appointed Fatimid governor of Ifr&icirc;qiya -- the Roman province of <I>Africa</I>, which then gave its name to the whole continent, often to the confusion of "<a href="notes/note-n.htm#note-21">Afro-Centric</a>" education.  As with the Abbasids, so with the Z&icirc;rids.  They began to drift away into autonomy.  In 1015, B&acirc;d&icirc;s ceded the western part of the territory to his uncle &#x1e24;amm&acirc;d, after a falling out over &#x1e24;amm&acirc;d's shift in allegiance to the Abbasids.  Thus we get a division between Algeria and Tunisia.  The Fatimids didn't much worry about autonomy in North Africa, but they were outraged when the Am&icirc;r al-Mu'izz changed his own allegiance to the Abbasids -- even while the Hamm&acirc;dids had returned to Shi'ism.<br clear=right>

<P><img src="history/islam-05.gif" align=right>The Fatimids were too weak at this point (1049) to visit their own vengeance, so they directed instead two Arab tribes, the Banu Hil&acirc;l and the Banu Sulaym, to do the job for them (1051).  The result was an unorganized pillaging, which mainly just ruined the countryside and hinterland.  The Z&icirc;rids and Hamm&acirc;dids moved down to the coast and built fleets.  This was useful against the <a href="italia.htm#sicily">Norman</a> conquest of Sicily but ultimately, by 1091, the Normans succeeded, ending the history of Islamic Sicily that had begun with the <a href="#aghlab">Aghlabids</a>.  Eventually the <a href="#muwah">Almohads</a> ended both regimes and unified North Africa again.<br clear=left>

While the Fatimids claimed descent from the Prophet's daughter F&acirc;&#x6d;ima, as descendants of the Seventh Im&acirc;m, Ism&acirc;'&icirc;l, there is little confidence and less evidence for this genealogy.  What it gave the Fatimids, however, was a claim to the Shi'ite Im&acirc;mate.  This was an Apocalyptic movement, coincidentally approaching the Millennium on the Christian calendar.  

<P>When the Fatimids occupied Egypt in 969, it did look like they might be the heirs of all of Isl&acirc;m.  The new capital founded in Egypt, <B>al-Q&acirc;hirah</B>, "the Victorious," although at the place of the Roman fortress of Babylon (of all things) and the Omayyad city of Fus&#x6d;&acirc;&#x6d; (Old Cairo), now becomes the classic Isl&acirc;mic capital of Egypt, Cairo.  While Fatimid control soon extended into the Levant and to the Holy Cities of the Hijaz, this proved to be the Fatimid high water mark.  In the Fatimid decline, North Africa broke away, the <a href="outremer.htm">Crusaders</a> arrived in the Levant, and the Fatimid succession itself passed to a collateral line that lost the numinous status of Shi'ite Im&acirc;m.  The last Fatimid Caliph, a sickly child, was allowed to die a natural death by the occupier of Egypt, <a href="#ayyub">Saladin</a>, before the regime was deposed.<br clear=right>

In 948 &#x1e24;asan al-Kalb&icirc; was made Fatimid governor of Sicily.  The conflict in the South of Italy was intense and there were times when a full Islamic Conquest would have seemed possible.  One of the high points of this may have been the Battle of Stilo, in Calabria, in 982.  The conflict had drawn in the German Emperor <a href="francia.htm#saxon">Otto II</a>, whose Byzantine wife, Theophano Scleraena, promoted the attention both of him and of their son, Otto III, to the lands of Romania in the South of Italy.  This was often not welcomed by the Emperors in Constantinople, and there were even rumors that at Stilo they favored the Arabs over Otto.  He was badly defeated by the Am&icirc;r Ab&ucirc; l-Q&acirc;sim 'Al&icirc; and many of his Germans were slaughtered.  Otto himself had to swim out to a (in this case helpful) Byzantine ship.  Howevr, the Am&icirc;r was killed, and the Kabl&icirc;s did not follow up their victory with any serious occupation of Calabria.  Stilo remains a picturest city today, with a conspicuously Byzantine style church.

<P>A few years later the Kabl&icirc;s had to contend with an ambitious attempt by Constantinople to reconquer Sicily (1038-1040), under the command of the excellent general, George Maniaces.  A fateful moment came when a Norman mercenary, William de Hauteville, met the Am&icirc;r of Syracuse in single combat during a sortee from the beseiged city.  De Hauteville killed him and earned the sobriquet "Iron Arm."  Syracuse was taken.  The question I am left with is whether this Am&icirc;r of Syracuse was none other than the Kalb&icirc; Am&icirc;r of Sicily.  The table lists the Am&icirc;r as Abdull&acirc;h, who is reported to have died in the same year, 1040; but Abdull&acirc;h is also said to have been the son of the Z&icirc;rid Am&icirc;r of Tunia, al-Mu'izz, who had been sent to Sicily to help the rebellion of the brother of al-Akhal, who in 1035 then appealed to Romania for help, before being assassinated in 1037.  Abdullah was defeated by Maniakes in open battle at Troina in 1040 and fled the island before the events at Syracuse.  I have been unable to clear this up, or find an alternative name for the Am&icirc;r of Syracuse.  Kalb&icirc; fortunes briefly revived, however.  Maniaces was suspected of treason and recalled.  De Hauteville and other mercenaries revolted and began the process of ejecting Romania from Italy, with De Hauteville's own dynasty of <a href="italia.htm#sicily">Normans</a> soon dominating and absorbing the older Christian states.  This provided a brief respite for Islamic Sicily, with Romania abandoning the island in 1042.  Successful on the mainland, the Normans turned their attention to Sicily, which William's half-brother Roger conquered between 1061 and 1091.  By then, the Kalb&icirc;s themselves were gone, and the local Muslims, fighting among themselves, were not able to resist as long at the Romanian regime had against the Aghlabids.  Sicily was restored to Christendom even as the <I>Reconquista</I> began in <a href="perifran.htm#reconquest">Spain</a>.<br clear=left>

With the Ghaznawids, Turkish leaders first appear as a major power in Isl&acirc;m.  With the celebrated <B>Ma&#x1e25;m&ucirc;d</B>, Isl&acirc;m also becomes for the first time a permanent factor in Indian history.  Ma&#x1e25;m&ucirc;d's invasions of India involved looting temples and smashing idols.  This was long remembered in anger by Hindus; but it was the first time in the history of Isl&acirc;m, since the <a href="#prophet">Prophet Mu&#x1e25;ammad's</a> reoccupation of Mecca, that idols could be smashed in real pagan temples.

Apart from the iconoclasm, however, Ma&#x1e25;m&ucirc;d does not seem to have displayed any hostility or persecution of Hindus themselves, whom he actually recruited for his army.  This began a long history of ambiguity, or worse, in the relations of Hindus and Moslems in India.  Isl&acirc;m always did best in India when tolerant, as under the <a href="sangoku.htm#moghuls">Moghul</a> Akbar, but could forfeit its strength suddenly with persecution.  <P>Note that the Arabic "w" in <I>Ghaznawid</I> is usually pronounced as a "v," as it would be in Persian or Turkish.

<P>The Sejuks created a great empire in Central Asia and profoundly transformed the politics and even the ethnology (with the spread of <a href="upan.htm#steppe">Turkic</a> peoples) of the Middle East.  After being freed from the Buwayids by the Orthodox Seljuks, the Caliph bestows a new title on &#x1e6c;ughrul Beg: &nbsp;<img src="images/greek/sultan.gif" align=middle>, <B>Sul&#x1e6d;&acirc;n</B> -- "Power, Dominion, Authority."  This looked like it might divide the ultimate authority in Isl&acirc;m into secular and divine halves, between the <I>Sul&#x1e6d;&acirc;n</I> and the Caliph.  It might have, had the Seljuk domain maintained its unity and its power, which it didn't.  The title of <I>Sul&#x1e6d;&acirc;n</I>, rather than signifying unique and universal authority, henceforth becomes the title of choice for successor states.  The greatest long term consequence, however, of the Seljuk state was the destruction of <a href="romania.htm#manz">Roman</a> power in Anatolia.  There was no way of knowing it at the time, but the battle of Manzikert in 1071 was the end of Mediaeval Romania and the beginning of modern <a href="turkia.htm">Turkey</a>.

<P>Under Alp Arslan and Malik Sh&acirc;h there was considerable intellectual and cultural achievement, in part encouraged by their great Vizir, Ni&#x1e93;&acirc;m al-Mulk.  This included the greatest of Islamic <a href="hist-1.htm#islam">philosophers</a>, <B>al-Ghaz&acirc;l&icirc;</B> (1058-1111), and the mathematician, astronomer, and poet <B>'Umar Khayy&acirc;m</B> (d.1122).  Khayy&acirc;m's fatalism, although with its Islamic overtones, may owe more to an Iranian sensibility, as would what seems to be his worldiness and even cynicism ("Of all that one should care to fathom, I was never deep in anything but Wine," as FitzGerald translated it).  Harsher times and considerably less intellectual daring were ahead.

<P>The map below shows Isl&acirc;m at the death of Malik Sh&acirc;h I (1092).  The Seljuk Great Sultanate, so vast (at least in Asia) and formidable, will now fragment, weaken, and disappear.  When the <a href="outremer.htm#jerusalem">First Crusade</a> arrives in 1098, neither Seljuks nor Fatimids are in any shape to resist it.  There is some irony in this, since the Crusades were initiated in response to the Seljuk conquest of Anatolia, which was then partially recovered for Romania.  The extent of Seljuk control over the Ghaznawids is unclear, but the <a href="#ghur">Gh&ucirc;rids</a> are just beginning their rise against their suzerains, whom they will replace (1186).  While the Gh&ucirc;rids fall to the Khw&acirc;razm Sh&acirc;hs (1215), their slave vassals in India found the Sultanate of Delhi.  The <a href="#murab">Almoravids</a> have crossed over to Spain, defeated the Christians (1086), and delayed the <I>Reconquista</I>.  When the Fatimid vassals, the Zirids of Tunisia, converted to Orthodox Isl&acirc;m (1049), the Fatimids rid themselves of some troublesome Arab tribes by directing them to North Africa.  This was a sterile revenge which gained the Fatimids nothing, but did contribute to an Arabization of North Africa.<br clear=right>

The Ghaznawids eventually came under the suzerainty of the Sejuks, and about the same time start displaying Persian rather than just Arabic (or Turkish) names.  Their end came from the Gh&ucirc;rids, one time vassals and now aggressive conquerers in their own right, following the last Ghaznawids to their last refuge in the Punjab.  Thus the first permanent Isl&acirc;mic state in Northern India became established, with the Gh&ucirc;rids own vassals beginning the line of the <a href="sangoku.htm#slaves">Sul&#x1e6d;&acirc;ns of Delhi</a> -- we even see a title with a word that will become very famous in India, <B>T&acirc;j ad-D&icirc;n</B>, "Crown of the Religion."  Soon, however, the power of the Khw&acirc;razm Sh&acirc;hs began to overtake the Gh&ucirc;rids -- though the Mongols were not far behind.<br clear=right>

For a while, the Seljuk successors, the Khw&acirc;razm Sh&acirc;hs, seemed on the way to restoring the Seljuk empire, and more.  By 1215, it looked like they had.  From Central Asia to Iraq to India, the Sh&acirc;hs held sway.  Unfortunately for them, <a href="mongol.htm#great">Genghis Khan</a> was on the move.  He arrived in 1220.  The Sh&acirc;h was crushed, but lingered in a rump of western Ir&acirc;n until 1231.  In that twilight period Sh&acirc;h Jal&acirc;l adD&icirc;n actually expanded into Azerbaijan and Georgia, but there was little he could do about the Mongols.

<P>Jal&acirc;l adD&icirc;n was deposed without a major expenditure of Mongol effort.  Greater effort came in 1256, when Qubilai Khan's brother H&uuml;l&auml;g&uuml; arrived with full Mongol force and the intention to conquer the whole Middle East.  The long Abbasid Caliphate ended when H&uuml;l&auml;g&uuml; killed the last Caliph, perhaps at the urging of his Christian wife.  The Seljuks of <a href="romania.htm#rum">R&ucirc;m</a> were subjugated, but then the <a href="mongol.htm#great">Great Khan</a> M&ouml;ngke died in 1259.  H&uuml;l&auml;g&uuml; returned to Mongolia to elect Qubilai Great Khan.  This permanently redirected the main force of the Mongols, now against <a href="sangoku.htm#yuan">China</a>.  When the <a href="#mamluk">Maml&ucirc;ks</a> defeated a Mongol party in 1260, this was the practical end of Mongol expansion in the Middle East.  Nevertheless, what was left was the massive state of the <a href="mongol.htm#ilkhan">Il Kh&acirc;ns</a>, which survived until collapsing in confusion in 1338.  This was a brief ascendancy; and the great traveler <B>Ibn Battuta</B>, who visited the Kh&acirc;n Ab&ucirc; Sa'&icirc;d in 1327, at the flood tide of Mongol power, found upon his return from China and India, in 1348, that the realm had already disintegrated.  Mongol successors, like the <a href="mongol.htm#jalay">Jalayirids</a> and the Black Sheep Turks, are followed on the <a href="mongol.htm">Mongol</a> page.<br clear=left>

The princes tended to disappear and the atabegs to become independent rulers.  In no case was this process as fateful as with Zang&icirc; 'Im&acirc;d ad-D&icirc;n, who took <a herf="outremer.htm#edessa">Edessa</a> from the Crusaders in 1144.<br>

<center><img src="history/zangid.gif"></center>

<br>This began what might be called the Isl&acirc;mic <I>Reconquista</I> of the Crusader states in the Middle East.  The vigor of Zang&icirc;'s house seemed to promise the complete defeat of the Crusaders, but Ma&#x1e25;m&ucirc;d N&ucirc;r ad-D&icirc;n chose his own lieutenants far too well for the preservation of Zangid authority.  His Kurdish general Sh&icirc;rk&ucirc;h completed the conquest of Egypt; but Sh&icirc;rk&ucirc;h then died, leaving authority to his nephew Y&ucirc;suf ibn 'Ayy&ucirc;b, who became <B>&#x1e62;al&acirc;&#x1e25;ud-D&icirc;n</B>.  N&ucirc;r ad-D&icirc;n soon discovered that &#x1e62;al&acirc;&#x1e25;ud-D&icirc;n had his own ideas about governing Egypt, like ignoring orders to depose the last Fatimid Caliph (who then died a natural death in 1171).  The insubordination of the subordinate soon was a practical independence that N&ucirc;r ad-D&icirc;n could not contest before his death (1174).  The tables were soon turned, as &#x1e62;al&acirc;&#x1e25;ud-D&icirc;n returned to take Damascus from the Zangids (1183) and then Jerusalem from the Crusaders (1187).  The Isl&acirc;mic <I>Reconquista</I> thus had passed to the <a href="#ayyub">Ayy&ucirc;bids</a>, as would eventually most of the rest of the Zangid possessions.  What the Ayy&ucirc;bids didn't get, the <a href="mongol.htm#ilkhan">Mongol Il Kh&acirc;ns</a> did.<br clear=left>

<P>Although originally ruling from Egypt, Saladin spent the last years of his life fighting in Syria and Palestine and was buried in Damascus, next to the Omayyad Mosque.  The Ayyubid family still survives in Lebanon and retains Saladin's sword.  His tomb is intact and open to visitors of the Omayyad Mosque.  It was even visited by Kaiser <a href="francia.htm#second">Wilhelm II</a> of Germany.

<P>Under Saladin, Cairo replaces Baghdad as the intellectual center of the Central Isl&acirc;mic lands.  The great Jewish philosopher <B>Moses Maimonides</B> (1135-1204) and the S&ucirc;f&icirc; <B>'Ibn 'Arab&icirc;</B> (1165-1240) both relocated from Spain to Egypt.  This climate became the subject of the play <I>Nathan der Weise</I> (1779) by Gotthold Lessing (1729-1781).  Saladin's toleration, however, had its limits, since he executed another S&ucirc;f&icirc;, <B>Suhraward&icirc;</B> (1153-1191) for heterodoxy -- less of a danger for Isl&acirc;mic mystics than for Christian, but still a problem.<br clear=left>

South of this, the broad area between the rivers came to be called the <img src="images/greek/nahrain.gif" align=middle>, <I>Nahrain</I>, the "Two Rivers," or the  <img src="images/greek/jazira.gif" align=middle>, <I>Jaz&icirc;ra</I>, the "Island."

<P>Today, the northern part of the <I>Jaz&icirc;ra</I> lies in Turkey and the southern part in Syria.  A corner of it lies in Iraq northwest of Mosul.  Edessa, long the principal city of the area and a <a href="outremer.htm#edessa">Crusader County</a>, is now the city of Urfa in Turkey.

<P>It is not clear from the sources who actually used the title <img src="images/greek/sultan.gif" align=middle>, <I>Sul&#x1e6d;&acirc;n</I>.  I have restricted it to the rulers in Egypt and Damascus.  Other rulers are simply "Lords," except in Yemen, whose ruler Rucimen calls "King."  As a matter of fact, every single one of these sovereigns employs the title <I>al-Malik</I>, i.e. "the King" -- so I have at least used it for Yemen.<br clear=left>

Almohad Spain ironically was distinguished by intellectual brilliance and by intolerant oppression.  Some of the most important Isl&acirc;mic and Jewish <a href="hist-1.htm#islam">philosophers</a> of the Middle Ages lived during the Almohad period.  The principal Isl&acirc;mic figures were <B>Ibn B&acirc;jja</B> (Avempace, d.1138), <B>Ibn &#x1e6c;ufayl</B> (Abubacer, d.1185), and especially, <B>Ibn Rushd</B> (Averroës, 1126-1198).  The great Jewish philosophers were <B>Moses Maimonides</B> (1135-1204) and <B>Moses Nahmanides</B> (1194-1270).  Ibn Rushd was probably one of the two or three greatest Isl&acirc;mic philosophers ever, and was certainly the most influential on subsequent thought in 13th Century Europe.  Maimonides was definitely the most important Jewish philosopher of the Middle Ages.  Both men suffered from the religious fanaticism of the Almohad regime.  Ibn Rushd was the last Isl&acirc;mic philosopher to rigorously defend Neoplatonic and Aristotelian principles that had come to be regarded as un-Isl&acirc;mic.  However, it was his skill as a physician that helped in his ultimate rehabilitation with the Caliph.  Maimonides, on the other hand, fled the Almohad persecution of Christians and Jews all the way to Egypt, where he found refuge at the court of <a href="#ayyub">Saladin</a>.  Nahmanides, on the other hand, was already a denizen of Christian Spain as, in his lifetime, the Almohads lost most of the Spain, abandoned the peninsula, and then were even overthrown in North Africa.

<P>The Almohads styled themselves Caliphs, something not always noted in historical summaries of the area.  Since they were Orthodox and the Abbasid line in Baghbad had not ended yet (though it would by the end of the dynasty), the precedent must have been the Omayyad Caliphate in Spain -- if there was even a concern with precedent.

With the decline of the Almohads, we get North Africa breaking up into familiar parts, Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia.  These modern divisions may not be perfectly natural, and the borders ebb and flow, but we are not that far from the modern divisions.  Morocco originally looks the most likely to retain the unity of the region, and briefly holds it, but otherwise is the most durable unit, with a continuous succession of rulers, despite some moments of anarchy or transition, down to the present.

<P>These tables are based on both <I>The New Islamic Dynasties</I> by Clifford Edmund Bosworth [Edinburgh University Press, 1996] and the <I>Oxford Dynasties of the World</I> by John E. Morby [Oxford University Press, 1989, 2002].  Bosworth has all of the rulers listed, while Morby gives only the Mar&icirc;nids [p.183] and &#x1e24;af&#x1e63;ids [p.185].  Morby has a clearer presentation, but Bosworth also has a brief discussion of the history.

<P>With the Crusades, Francia begins to develop the seapower that enables it to return to North Africa.  On the Seventh Crusade in 1270, <a href="francia.htm#templars"><font color="#000000">St. Louis IX</font></a> of France lands in Tunisia, formally as a preparation to return to Egypt but apparently simply at the self-interested urging of his brother, <a href="italia.htm#anjou-2">Charles of Anjou</a>, who wanted to enlarge his Mediterranean empire.  He dies instead and accomplishes nothing for Charles -- it is also the last Crusade.

<P>After completing the expulsion of Isl&acirc;m from Spain, both Spain and Portugal become intent on expanding into North Africa.  Various cities get taken and held for a time, and local rulers become temporary vassals, but nothing permanent gets accomplished and it seems impossible to establish a durable or extensive presence on the continent.

<P>It is not Europe but Turkey that actually does this.  Both the &#x1e24;af&#x1e63;ids and Ziy&acirc;nds come to an end with the Turkish conquest.  Indeed, in the last stages, the local rulers sometimes relied on the Christians as allies against the Turks.  North Africa thus became a theater of the larger conflict between Christendom and the Ottomans.

<P>North Africa, however, was a long way from Constantinople.  And as the Turkish reach slackened with time, local governors and princes began to run their own operations.  This came to mean piracy and slaving.  We enter the period of the <B>Barbary States</B>, a good three hundred years, when corsairs, from Algeria especially, were a plague on the surrounding seas, with ship after ship taken, and Christian crews and passengers sold on the slave markets.  After 1604, when English pirates taught them Atlantic navigation, Barbary ships ranged as far as Newfoundland and even captured ships in Plymouth harbor.  <img src="images/slavegre.jpg" align=right width=200>Between 1609 and 1616, they captured 446 English ships and sold more than 7000 English captives as slaves.  Some such captives might be ransomed, but many others were lost the rest of their lives.

<P>At right we have a sculpture, "The Greek Slave," by Hiram Powers [1844], which is supposed to be a Greek women captured by the Turks and sold into slavery.  At the opposite end of the Mediterranean, and after the relevant era, she would probably not be a captive of the Barbary Pirates, but slavery in Islam was not confined to them and there is nothing ahistorical or untrue about imagining Greek slaves of the Ottomans, as Powers himself imagined her a captive because of the revolt of the <a href="turkia.htm#greeks">Greeks</a>.  Such a sculpture might serve several purposes.  One would be to publicize the reality of the Muslim slave market, whether in North Africa or elsewhere.  It also does this with an example of the humiliating exposure of a helpless victim, which raises slavery as a sexual issue.  We might see this as part of an extreme subset of the business, but it is not a falsehood.  The sexual slavery practiced recently (2014/2016) by Boko Haram in Nigeria and ISIS in Iraq and Syria is a conspicuous revival of the practice -- the leader of Boko Haram publicly boasted of what he was doing.  At the same time, we can also see "The Greek Slave" as an opportunity to engage in a bit of mild <a href="porno.htm">pornography</a>, with the image of the helpless women actually appealing to sexual fantasies.  This could be called a form of "Orientalism," by which the East is fictionalized and sexualized by what are essentially Western desires.  However, since there is nothing <I>inaccurate</I> about portrayals of sexual slavery in Islam, accusations of "Orientalism" can be seen as a self-interested and dishonest way of deflecting and concealing attention from the realities of Islamic civilization.  Nor, as noted, is this merely a matter of historical interest.  In Nigeria, Iraq, and Syria, even as I write, women are being constantly raped by Jihadists, a situation that curiously seems to draw relatively little attention, and less ire, from Western <a href="feminism.htm">feminists</a>, whose own animus may be directed elsewhere.

<P>Christian states were scandalized by the piracy and slave trade, but punitive expeditions were usually no more successful than they had been since St. Louis.  An English expedition against Algeria in 1620 was a failure, but one in 1637 was more successful, seizing the city of Salee, with 300 captives freed.  Nevertheless, it was easier to pay for "protection" and buy off the pirates (who also sometimes could be used as allies against other European powers).  This was never more than partially effective, since, as the saying goes, once you pay the Danegeld, you can't get rid of the <a href="germania.htm#norse">Dane</a> (very similar kinds of pirates and slavers, as pagans, in their day).

<P>The situation became especially infuriating to the new but distant United States of America.  After paying $2,000,000 in extortion money, <a href="presiden.htm#3">Thomas Jefferson</a> had had enough and in 1801 sent the U.S. Navy and Marines against the city of <a href="#tripoli">Tripoli</a> (actually just east of Tunisia, in modern <a href="turkia.htm#libya">Libya</a>).  This brought at least a temporary respite, and contributed a phrase ("the shores of Tripoli") to the Marine Hymn.  The piracy and slaving did not really and fully end, however, until the French landed in Algeria, intent upon conquest, in 1830.  They had a hard fight against the local charismatic leader, Abd al-Kader, from 1832 to 1847, but they accomplished the task.  Fighting there would often be in French Algeria, for which the legendary <a href="francia.htm#legion">Foreign Legion</a> would be created, but local pirates would no longer plague the seas or harvest Christian merchants and travellers for hostages and slaves.  This is now entirely forgotten by people who want to blame Europeans, or even specifically Americans, for slavery (or "imperialism"), with the idea that they invented it just to oppress Africans.  It is often actually Africans who must remind <a href="antiam.htm">anti-American</a> Americans that the slave trade originated with Arabs and Africans themselves.  The following section throws yet another light on this.<br clear=left>

Mali was the first literate sub-Saharan African kingdom since <a href="ethiopia.htm">Abyssinia</a>, and the first Isl&acirc;mic one.  The city of <B>Timbuktu</B> on the Niger River, although not the capital of Mali, was nevertheless probably the most famous city of the area (and now of the region), at the end of the caravan routes from North Africa.  Pilgrimages of the Kings of Mali to Mecca, passing through Cairo, drew considerable attention, especially that of <B>Mans&acirc; M&ucirc;s&acirc; I</B>, whose attendants, walking by camels, all carried staffs covered in gold.  His reign also saw a visit to the Kingdom from the great traveller Ibn Ba&#x6d;&#x6d;&ucirc;&#x6d;a, who observed, among other things, that the sexual mores of the people were somewhat less rigorous than required by Islam.  Indeed, some accommodation with pre-Islamic practices long persisted.

<P>The Islam that the Kings of Mali <I>did</I> want rigorously enforced was the prohibition of taking Muslims as slaves.  Slavers from North Africa usually regarded all black people, Muslims or not, as fair game, and this became a matter of continuing annoyance, outrage, and reproach over time.  The recent self-righteous expressing indignation over the European slave trade from the coast of West Africa usually forget that the trade began and long continued, in much the same volume, across the Sahara to the Arab north.  There are few descendants of those slaves in Arab countries today, reflecting the harshness of their treatment, including the castration of the men.

<P>Today this area suffers from an advance of the desert that has continued through all historical time.  The Sahara has only gotten worse in the last five thousand years and more.  The mediaeval kingdom thus enjoyed considerable rainfall and arable land now lost.  The modern Republic of Mali, although encompassing some of the same territory as the old Kingdom, nevertheless has no direct connection to it and is named just in commemoration of it.

<P>The fury and <a href="poly-1b.htm#text-3">anaesthesia</a> of <a href="afghan.htm#fascism">Islamic Fascism</a> have now come to historic and fabled Timbuktu.  In late June, 2012, Islamist fanatics, such as the "Ansar Dine" group, have by pick-axes, hoes, and fire destroyed the tombs of the Mediaeval Muslim Saints Sidi Mahmoud, Sidi Moctar, and Alpha Moya in Timbuktu, previously called the "city of 333 Saints."  <img src="images/timbuktu.jpg" align=right>This is consistent with the vandalism visited on cultural and religious artifacts by Jihadists, as most notoriously seen in the destruction of Buddhist art and monuments in <a href="hist-1.htm#text-10">Afghanistan</a>; but it may surprise some that <I>Islamic</I> monuments, in this case ones designated by UNESCO as "world-heritage" sites, are now the target.  But the <a href="#saudi">Wahhabist</a> inspired Islam of modern zealots regards the veneration or even commemoration of saints as un-Islamic, and they scruple at no death or destruction to enforce their particular fundamentalism.  Since their fire also burned priceless manuscripts in the tombs, they are also indifferent to traditions of Islamic literature and historiography.  In short, they are savages and barbarians, in the fullest senses of those terms.  It is extraordinary that the modern world still has to deal with people like this.  Much worse, such movements seem to be admired and supported by many Muslims, while <a href="presiden.htm#44">Barack Obama</a>, while taking some measures against them, continues to express complacency about the level of threat they represent --

<P>Mali was the scene of an attempted coup in March, 2012, and this unleashed the anarchy and fanaticism that now are in play in the north of the country.  Many more tombs in Timbuktu are vulnerable to destruction; but the intervention of French troops later secured the situation for the time being.

<hr>

<P>The successor to Mali on the Niger River, Songhay had begun a good bit earlier, back in the 9th century.  However, there really are no dates before the Si (or Sonni) dynasty, beginning with 'Al&icirc; Golom (or Kolon) around 1275.  Songhay is then a vassal of Mali.  After that, things are still obscure, with few dates and even poorly attested names for the rulers until Sonni 'Al&icirc; "the Great," who definitively established the ascendency of Songhay in the area.  In short order Mu&#x1e25;ammad I Ture Askiya founds a new dynasty, which continues until the Morocco conquest.  The Moroccans had the advantage at this point of firearms, but their ability to hold the area was limited.  Even the presence of a Moroccan governor in Timbuktu seems to have lapsed around 1660.  The region fell into disorder.

The pool of candidates for the Sultanate was from the ranks of the soldiers bought as slaves when children and then raised to rule Egypt.  This force originated under the Ayy&ucirc;bids, as a similar practice created an elite army, the Janissaries, under the <a href="turkia.htm#janissari">Ottomans</a>.  While the Janissaries were eventually massacred (1826) for their practice of king-making, the Maml&ucirc;ks were successful at replacing the Ayy&ucirc;bid Sul&#x1e6d;&acirc;ns of Egypt completely, with themselves (1252).

<P>Slave troops at first were Turkish, but then preference shifted, as it did with the Ottomans, to originally Christian boys from the <a href="armenia.htm#culmen">Caucasus</a>, especially Circassians.  Although Cairo was a major terminus for the African slave trade, black boys were not used for this purpose -- they were generally castrated and used as harem eunuchs, or even at the shrines in Mecca and Medina.

<P>Although the Maml&ucirc;k Sul&#x1e6d;&acirc;nate formally and by reputation was non-hereditary, it does turn out that many of the Sul&#x1e6d;&acirc;ns were sons or brothers of others.  This can be seen in Bosworth's <I>The New Islamic Dynasties</I> [pp.76-78] and, rather more clearly, in the <I>Oxford Dynasties of the World</I> by John. E. Morby [Oxford, 2002, pp.189-190] -- note that a genealogy of the Egyptian Abbasid Caliphs is given <a href="#abbasgen">above</a>.

<P>Maml&ucirc;k Egypt for many years was the principal state of Isl&acirc;m.  The defeat of the Mongols in 1260 and then the establishment of an Abbasid line of Caliphs in Cairo gave the regime a respect and status that others could not match.  The architectural monuments of Maml&ucirc;k Cairo are still impressive, and it is noteworthy that the great collection of Mediaeval Isl&acirc;mic stories, the <I>Alf Layla wa Layla</I>, <img src="images/greek/layla.gif" align=middle><img src="images/greek/wa.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/layla.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/alf.gif" align=middle> (<I>Thousand Nights and a Night</I>, i.e. the <I>Thousand and One Nights</I>), achieved definitive form in Cairo around 1400.  Modern translations, however, often include some stories that are not in the original Arabic edition.

<P>This collection, including stories that must have been circulating for many centuries, is noteworthy for the social, cultural, and religious attitudes it reveals.  While fiercely pro-Isl&acirc;mic, with stories even about questions of Isl&acirc;mic Law, and a very long and boring one about fighting the <a href="romania.htm#macedon">Romans</a> (with nice touches like the notion that Christian incense is made from the excrement of Bishops), we find things that now seem rather un-Isl&acirc;mic.  For instance, there is a great deal of wine drinking, which seems to be casually accepted, even while its irreligion, strictly speaking, is noted.

<P>Thus, in one story, a character swears off wine in order to purify himself for the Pilgrimage.  In another story, a man discovers that his wife has been having sex with a gorilla.  With a shocking touch of <a href="racism.htm">racism</a>, this affair is said to have commenced after a previous <I>black</I> lover had died (which fits the surviving stereotype of black sexual prowess but betrays ignorance of the anatomy of gorillas, which actually have smaller genitals than humans).  We might expect that the proper thing to do about this would be to kill the wife.  However, the wife's unnatural lust is extraordinarily treated as a <I>medical</I> disorder, and a physician is employed to cure her, which he does.  Besides the wine drinking, there seems to be considerable ease and interest in unsanctioned sexual activities.  Even those eunuchs who have been deprived of their testicles but not their penises boast of their ability to have sex with their mistresses.  One real world consequence of that was the custom of only using black eunuchs, who typically had amputated penises, in the har&icirc;m.

<P>Although the story of the Maml&ucirc;ks is easily thought to end in 1517 with the Ottoman conquest, the amazing truth is that the Maml&ucirc;k garrison was not abolished by the Turks and that, as Ottoman authority weakened, Egypt ended up again under the <I>de facto</I> rule of the same "peculiar institution."  Thus, when Napoleon arrived in Egypt in 1798, it was the Maml&ucirc;ks with whom he had to contend.  When he defeated them at the Battle of the Pyramids, he may not have stopped to think (so distracted by all the Egyptian stuff) that he had beaten victors over the Mongols.  Nevertheless, this was still not the end of the Maml&ucirc;k story.  They retreated up the Nile from the French and were again contesting the rule of Egypt when <a href="turkia.htm#egypt">Mu&#x1e25;ammad 'Al&icirc;</a> deceived, trapped, and exterminated them in 1811.

<P>What did end in 1517 was the line of Abbasid Caliphs.  The last was taken off to Constantinople.  Ironically, this was al-Mutawakkil III -- the same title as the Caliph who was assassinated by his own Turkish guard in 861.  It is not clear whether the Ottomans had any intention of continuing the line, as useful figureheads, as the Maml&ucirc;ks had, for the Caliph and any possible descendants simply disappear from history.  Later, when the Sul&#x1e6d;&acirc;ns got to thinking about it, they claimed the Caliphate for themselves.<br clear=left>

The end of Isl&acirc;mic Spain turned out to be a very protracted business, 260 years to be exact.  In the course of this, one of the architectural jewels of the world was created, the <B>Alhambra</B> (<I>al-&#x1e24;amr&acirc;'</I>, "the Red").  When the real end came, it was by no means easy for the Christians.  A long and tough campaign finally resulted in a negotiated surrender.  Mu&#x1e25;ammad XII (Boabdil), left for North Africa, and freedom of religion was supposedly obtained for Granadan Moslems (1492).  Frustration with this incomplete victory may have helped <a href="perifran.htm#conquest">Ferdinand and Isabella</a> with their resolve to expel the Jews from Spain.  Toleration for Moslems, however, was revoked as soon as 1499.  Actions against the <I>Moriscos</I>, Christian converts from Isl&acirc;m, led to a great revolt in 1568-1570.  Dispersed through Spain, the remaining <I>Moriscos</I> nevertheless were enough of a worry that it was determined in 1609 to expel them from Spain altogether.  By 1614, they were gone, and with them the last link with the 700 years of Isl&acirc;mic Spain.<br clear=right>

<P>The Alhambra (a redundant expression, since "al" already means "the") survives out of its time as a living fossil of Isl&acirc;mic Spain -- with its name transported to a city in Southern <a href="./ross/calif.htm">California</a>, where at least the climate is similar.  Another echo of Islamic Spain lives in California, however, where the Mission San Gabriel Arc&aacute;ngel <img src="ross/mss-sga.jpg" width=225 align=right>reflects, on a more humble scale, architectural elements of the Great Mosque of Cordova (which survived through its conversion into the church).  The builder of the Mission, it seems, was from Cordova.  The buttresses unique to California Missions, unfortunately, have not always preserved San Gabriel from earthquake damage.  An image of San Gabriel has recently been proposed for the Seal of the County of Los Angeles, since the City of Los Angeles was originally founded in 1781 as an <I>asistencia</I> or outlier of the Mission.<br clear=right>

Isl&acirc;m in Southeast Asia is the counterexample to the notion sometimes affirmed that the religion has never spread except by the sword.  Instead, Isl&acirc;m arrived in Malaya and Indonesia by sea and by trade.  It took hold gradually against Hinduism and Buddhism, which had previously arrived by sea and by trade.  One result of this was gradual and incomplete Islamicization, i.e. the previous civilization was not simply superseded and the social rigors of Isl&acirc;mic law only adopted imperfectly.  This can be seen in the very names of the Sul&#x1e6d;&acirc;ns of Malacca, which begin with Sanskrit, including titles like <I>shri</I>, <I>r&acirc;j&acirc;</I>, and <I>mahar&acirc;j&acirc;</I>, and shift over to Arabic and Persian, including titles like <I>Sul&#x1e6d;&acirc;n</I> and <I>sh&acirc;h</I>.  With the last three rulers before the Portuguese, the Sanskrit titles and names have disappeared entirely.  The most remarkable name/title is undoubtedly <I>deva</I>, "god."  This is familiar from an early date in <a href="sangoku.htm#kushan">India</a> but would be absolutely anathema in Isl&acirc;m -- its implication of polytheism would even be punishable by death under Islamic Law.  Indeed, it only occurs once, and that with a ruler whose name otherwise seems to put more emphasis on the Indian elements.<br clear=left>

<P><img src="images/maps/zhenghe1.gif" align=left><br clear=right>

<P>At the beginning of the line of the Sul&#x1e6d;&acirc;ns of Malacca, it was <a href="perigoku.htm#siam">Siam</a> that exerted influence.  But then in 1409 the Chinese arrived.  Admiral Zheng He and his great fleets, projecting the new power of the <a href="sangoku.htm#ming">Ming Dynasty</a>, established a base at Malacca, and the Sul&#x1e6d;&acirc;n became a tributary of China.  He even sailed to China to pay homage to the Emperor.  A Chinese cantonment protected, stored, and shipped goods from China and those obtained on the further expeditions into the Indian Ocean.  On nearby Sumatra, a Chinese governor was installed at Palembang after a Chinese pirate was defeated, captured, and sent back to China for execution.  In northern Sumatra (near Acheh), troops were put ashore to install one king and execute his rival.  A king in <a href="buddhism.htm#ceylon">Ceylon</a> was defeated and sent to China, but then the Emperor returned him to his kingdom (thought he evidently was unable to recover his throne).  Some of Zheng He's detachments went into the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea, and even down the coast of Africa, perhaps as far as Zanzibar.  This impressive exercise ended abruptly in 1433, when the xenophobic <a href="confuci.htm">Confucian</a> faction became dominant at the Chinese Court.  China was cut off from the external world and began to lose its ability to deal with that world, either culturally, economically, or militarily.

<P>Arriving next by sea and by trade would be the <a href="newspain.htm">Portuguese</a> (led by Afonso de Albuquerque), Dutch, and <a href="british.htm">British</a>, all of whom were also interested in secure bases for their activities.  So Malacca became a European colony.  Under the British, it became part of the <I>Straits Settlements</I>, which was a string of cities along, indeed, the Straits of Malacca, between Malaya and Sumatra.  British Malaya was otherwise a group of client kingdoms, including some whose rulers were actually descendants of the Sul&#x1e6d;&acirc;ns of Malacca.<br clear=right>

<P>In 1972 I was looking through some books that were on sale at the University of Hawai'i bookstore.  Among them I found two small pamphlets that looked <img src="history/alpha-t.gif" align=left>like children's primers written entirely in the Arabic alphabet.  I had no idea what these could be, or what they were doing in <a href="hawaii.htm">Hawai'i</a>.  They were, however, published in <a href="notes/india.htm#malaya">Singapore</a> by the "Malaysia Press Ltd."  This was the clue; for, as I soon learned, and as is generally characteristic in Mediaeval Islamic converts, the Arabic alphabet is adopted to write the local language, which was <B>Malay</B>, <img src="images/greek/malay.gif" align=middle>, <I>Melayu</I>.  This grew up as a <a href="upan.htm">trade language</a> of Malaya and Indonesia,

a <I>linga franca</I>, like Swahili in East Africa and Hindi-Urdu in India.  Like those languages, Malay has a strong element of Arabic in it, though this is often obscured by the pronunciation.  Thus, a basic greeting in Malay is <I>Apa kabar?</I>  This simply means "What's new?"  <I>Apa</I> is a Malay word, but <I>kabar</I> is from Arabic <img src="images/greek/khabar.gif" align=middle>, <I>khabar</I>, "news, information, report."  Malay is now the national language of Malaysia (<I>Bahasa Malaysia</I>), Indonesia (<I>Bahasa Indonesia</I>), and Singapore (<I>Bahasa Melayu</I>).  The British and the Dutch introduced systems of Romanization -- e.g. "u" in Malaya was "oe" in Indonesia -- which now have been reconciled to a universal standard, with the Dutch idiosyncrasies eliminated.  <img src="images/greek/arabic-m.gif" align=left>The use of the Arabic alphabet had been dying out, but not entirely.

<P>As initially in <a href="iran.htm#iran">Persian</a>, it was necessary to introduce some extra letters into the alphabet to write all the sounds of Malay.  These would be, most importantly, letters for the velar nasal "ng" and the palatal nasal "ny" (or "&ntilde;").  <img src="images/greek/arabic-p.gif" align=right>A small problem arose with writing three dots over the "chair" for an "n" with "ny."  In the final or independent position, the letter would be distinctive.  Written initially or medially, however, the letter would look like the Arabic "th."  Thus, in the initial or medial positions, the three dots for "ny" are written under rather than over the "chair."  This, however, would then look like the Persian "p."  Malay also needed a "p," so the "chair" of Arabic "f" was used, with three dots, for the "p."  Otherwise, we get the variation that "g," borrowed from Persian, might be written with a dot rather than an extra line; and Arabic "w," pronounced "v" in Persian, could be left alone to mean "w" in Malay or written with a dot to mean "v."  Otherwise, "ch" was also borrowed from Persian.

<P>The way things are going in Isl&acirc;m, it may well be that the use of the Arabic alphabet will increase; but little of it had been left in public life.

<P><hr>

<P>Acheh at the northern end of Sumatra, just across the Straits from Malacca, was a larger and more durable realm.  We see less in the way of Sanskrit names and titles, though there are some local names and references, as with A&#x1e25;mad Sh&acirc;h (1727-1735), who is called Mahar&acirc;j&acirc; Lela Melayu -- i.e. "the Malay."  We also see something very unusual in Islam, a number of female rulers.

<P>In 1563 Sul&#x1e6d;&acirc;n Ri'&acirc;yat Sh&acirc;h of Acheh wrote to the Ottoman Sul&#x1e6d;&acirc;n, in this case no less than <a href="turkia.htm#mohacs">Suleiman the Magnificent</a>, requesting help against the Portuguese.  This episode reveals the extent of the Oecumene of Isl&acirc;m, and the recognition of the common enemy.  Turkey at the height of its power, and willing to help, nevertheless had some difficulty projecting that power as far as Indonesia.  After a delay of some years, and not until after the death of Suleiman, an Ottoman fleet of 19 ships sailed from Egypt.  Only two ships reached Acheh, however, the rest having been diverted to bolster Ottoman authority in <a href="#tahirids">Yemen</a>.  The aid finally delivered to Acheh was thus minimal and, as it happened, ineffective.

<P>While it is tempting now to think of Indonesia as a unified realm, not only were there multiple sovereignties in earlier days, but their subjugation by the <a href="lorraine.htm#netherlands">Dutch</a> was a process that took some time.  Thus, the last Sul&#x1e6d;&acirc;n of Acheh held out for many years, and the Dutch conquest was not complete until 1903.  We see much the same process in Bali, where Dutch conquest was not complete until 1906, amid scenes of great slaughter, something like 3600 Balinese falling.

<P><a name="volcano">Acheh entered the news late in 2004 with a great earthquake, magnitude 9.0, the largest on Earth in forty years, off the coast of Sumatra.  This was bad enough, but the <I>tsunami</I>, <img src="images/hiero/harbor.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/wave.gif" align=middle>, generated by the earthquake inundated coasts as far away as Sri Lanka and Thailand.  The death toll overall is estimated up to 200,000 people.

<P>We are thus unpleasantly reminded of the geological forces at work under Indonesia, where many great earthquakes and some of the largest volcanic eruptions in the geological record have occurred.  For instance, the eruption of Mt. Tambora in 1815 put so much material into the atmosphere that it darkened the sky world wide and produced "the year without summer" in 1816 -- producing the cold and rains in Europe that enforced the leisure for Mary Shelley to write <I>Frankenstein</I> [1818].  

<P>Not as large but better known was the eruption of Karakatoa (Krakatau, between Java and Sumatra) in 1883.  This blew away the small island of Karakatoa itself, with a blast that was actually heard as far as 1000 miles away.  There have been few such eruptions anywhere in historical times.  Ice cores show a spike of volcanic gasses for 535 AD.  It was long not known if this was one of the Indonesian volcanoes.  They were the best candidates; but now it turns out that this must have been <a href="romania.htm#volcano">Mt. Ilopango</a> in El Salvador, which would have been an eruption as large or larger than Tambora.  Such eruptions did have some serious historical consequences.  There is much comment in <a href="romania.htm#climate">Roman records</a> of the time about the dim sunlight of 536 AD and the failure of crops thereafter.  The cooling may have precipitated the plague that arrived in Egypt in 541.  The "Dark Ages Cooling" was thus another heavy blow against the diminishing <a href="romania.htm#fourth">Roman Empire</a>.

<P>Prehistorically, Sumatra may have been the place of the largest volcanic eruption in the history of the human species.  When Mt. Toba erupted 74,000 years ago, it was perhaps 10,000 times the size of the Mt. St. Helens eruption in 1980.  This could have caused a 5<sup>o</sup> Celsius (9<sup>o</sup> Fahrenheit) global drop in temperature around the world.  The "year without summer" might have become months or years without summer.  There is some evidence that this caused a "genetic bottleneck" in human evolution, which means a large portion of human beings may have died.  This was before the advent of fully <a href="trees.htm#evolution">modern humans</a>, about 30,000 years ago; so, literally, people like us have not seen its like.<br clear=right>

<P><B>Yemen</B> is an ancient and noteworthy center of civilization.  It was long off the beaten track, at the entrance to the Red Sea, and rarely the focus, or the target, of major political events; but it certainly deserves more attention than it customarily receives.  For instance, the recent and enormous (911 pages) <I>Ancient History, from the First Civilizations to the Renaissance</I>, by J.M. Roberts [Duncan Baird Publishers, London, 2004], contains nothing whatsoever about Yemen, and neither the name, nor "Saba," nor "Sheba," even appear in the index.  This is a grotesque but not unusual oversight.

<P>If there were no ruins or no records, this neglect might be expected; but there are both.  South Arabia, indeed, has its own derived version of the alphabet, which survives today in its <a href="ethiopia.htm#alphabet">Ethiopian<img src="images/greek/yemen.gif" align=left border=0></a> version.  As for inscriptions and literature, Joan Copeland Biella says, in her <I>Dictionary of Old South Arabic</I> [Harvard Semitic Museum Studies 25, 1982]:

<P><table><tr><td><blockquote>....thousands of texts in Sabaean, Minnaean, Qatabanian and &#x1e24;a&#x1e0d;ramitic have been published, ranging in type from brief graffiti to substantial historical annals. [p.vii]</blockquote></td></tr></table>

<P>One would never know this from treatments of ancient history like Roberts' book.

<P>The ruins are extensive and include unique structures, like the extraordinary <B>Ma'rib Dam</B> (<I>Sadd Ma'rib</I>, <img src="images/greek/marib.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/dam.gif" align=middle>, in Arabic), built from cut stone in the Wad&icirc; Sadd (or Wadi Saba').  This was 1,800 feet long and was not alone, except in scale and fame, in the irrigation of the region.  Much is left of the structure, including its spillway system.

<P>The Ma'rib Dam should have rated as one of the <a href="hist-1.htm#wonders">Seven Wonders of the World</a>.  Its final and catastrophic break, however, which entered into Isl&acirc;mic legend, represented the definitive decline of the area and also the uncertainties of Yemeni history, since the event cannot be well dated -- just between the 5th and the 7th centuries AD.

<P>The name of Yemen itself is of interest.  The Romans called the area <B>Arabia Felix</B>, "happy" or "fortunate" Arabia, in contrast to <I>Arabia Deserta</I>, "desert" Arabia, and <I>Arabia Petraea</I>, "rocky" Arabia (where the Romans annexed the remarkable city of <a href="hist-1.htm#petra">Petra</a>).  As it happens, Yemen in Arabic, <img src="images/greek/yaman.gif" align=middle>, <B>al-Yaman</B>, is from a verb, <img src="images/greek/yamana.gif" align=middle>, <I>yamana</I>, that can mean "to be lucky, fortunate."  <I>Yaman</I> can also mean "right side or hand" and "south."  This can be contrasted with <I>sh&acirc;m</I>, which can mean "north," "Syria," and "Damascus" but from a root that can also mean "evil omen," "ominous," "calamity," and "misfortune."  The actual word for left in Arabic is different, <I>sham&acirc;l</I> -- which can also mean north (we don't get the sinister associations with this root).  Indeed, if one faces east, the south is on one's right and the north on the left.  And Arabic is not the only language in which right (<I>dexter</I>) is lucky and left (<I>sinister</I>) threatening.

<P>The only proper history book in print that I have found for South Arabia is Robert G. Hoyland's <I>Arabia and the Arabs, From the Bronze Age to the Coming of Islam</I> [Routledge, 2001].  For the historiography of South Arabia, he says:

<P><blockquote>....we are equipped with some ten thousand inscriptions.  Unfortunately, however, these are not dated according to an absolute era until the first century AD and they almost never allude to events outside south Arabia.  Scholars have tried to arrange them in chronological order according to the style of their script, but with hardly any firmly dated examples to provide a fixed point this method can offer no more than a rough indication. [p.36]</blockquote><br clear=right>

With the neglect and uncertainties of Yemeni history, I have found little to go on for displaying the chronology.  Hoyland refers to "lists of Sabaean rulers," but then doesn't mention if these are provided by the Sabaeans (like the <a href="notes/oldking.htm">Egyptian</a> king lists), assembled by modern scholars, or found in Arab legend.  He certainly doesn't provide any such list.  The only lists of kings I have found are in <a href="http://www.hostkingdom.net/regindex.html">Bruce R. Gordon's Regnal Chronologies</a>.  Where Bruce gets this stuff, I would like to know.  He does say that the earliest material is "culled entirely from traditional sources," apparently meaning that it is legendary in nature and of doubtful historical value.  Indeed, the earliest list he gives includes "a son of the eponymous ancestor of the Habiru (Hebrew) nomadic peoples."  This is part of legendary genealogy, not history.  I have skipped that list.  But what I do give first, the list of kings of Tababi'a <a href="#tababia">above</a>, begins with reigns that are more than a century long.  When it comes to the kings of <B>Saba'</B>, the classic kingdom of Yemen, Gordon says, "sources I have for early Yemeni states disagree to a large extent, and cannot be reconciled with any clarity."  Thus, he simply gives two different lists for Saba'.  They are presented side by side here.  They both do end with the same king, Ilasharah Yahdub, but one dates him close to the beginning of the Christian Era, the other a good century later.  This is like the degree of uncertainty and variation that one gets with thinly historical material like that of nearby early <a href="ethiopia.htm">Ethiopia</a> or even the (contemporary and equally remote) Greek Kingdom of <a href="hist-1.htm#text-10">Bactria</a>.  It is also noteworthy that Old South Arabic did not write vowels.  Genuine Sabaean texts are without vowels.  The names of the kings given in these lists thus cannot have been derived directly from Yemeni epigraphy or annals.  I am left wondering how much of Sabaean history actually can be reconstructed from contemporary sources, and how much of this derives from later texts and legends.  Although Hoyland mentions the latter, he does not discuss the nature of their use or value.

<P>The legends, indeed, extend to the Old Testament.  The kingdom of Saba' is the Biblical <B>Sheba</B>.  Here the reign of <a href="notes/newking.htm#israel">Solomon</a> is dated 970-931 BC.  This antedates the beginning of either list here for Saba', and all the reasonable reigns even for <a href="#tababia">at-Tababi'a</a> -- though Balkis is the candidate for the Biblical "Queen of Sheba."  Hoyland suspects that the reference to Sheba "may only have been slipped in at a later date" [p.39].  It was long doubtful that developed states even existed in that era; but Hoyland says that now it seems more likely that things were happening by Solomon's 10th century, though we don't have texts appearing until the 8th.  The rulers of Saba' were kings (<I>mlk</I>, Arabic <I>malik</I>, <img src="images/greek/malik.gif" align=middle>) or "unifiers" (<I>mkrb</I>, Arabized rendering <I>mukarrib</I>, <img src="images/greek/mukarrib.gif" align=middle>).  It is not clear what the relationship was between these titles, and the <I>mukarribs</I> are often regarded as early priest-kings or as later "emperors."  There are a couple of female rulers given in the lists, so it is conceivable that there was a Queen of Sheba as in the Biblical story.  Her visit to Jerusalem, of course, is also part of <a href="ethiopia.htm">Ethiopian</a> legend, since her son by Solomon is supposed to have been Menelik, the founder of the Abyssinian state.  There is little doubt that these stories, whatever their historicity, reflect the existence and development, even if in later periods, of sophisticated states in South Arabia and adjacent Africa.

<P>The early development of Saba' and the other states in the area was on the inland, the eastern slopes of the mountains.  The <I>wad&icirc;</I> dammed at Ma'rib thus flows into a desert basin; and the city of Ma'rib itself, capital of the Sabaeans, is at the foot of the mountains.  This is very different from what we might expect, which would be a watershed flowing west into the Red Sea, with the cities concentrated there.  But that is not what we see.  Development occurring in this way was coupled to the caravan routes, which headed up inland.  Even from later history it is noteworthy that Mecca, a caravan center itself, is well in from the coast.  Part of the considerations for all this may have been the danger of pirates in the Red Sea.  Coastal depots, unless sufficiency fortified, could be attached with complete surprise, by enemies who could vanish to distant and unknown sources -- like Somali pirates in our own day.

<P>In three voyages between 117 and 109 BC, however, <B>Eudoxus of Cyzicus</B> is supposed to have learned how to use the monsoons to sail all the way from (<a href="hist-1.htm#text-9">Ptolemaic</a>) Egypt to India and back.  One might have suspected South Arabians to have known about this already, but the evidence that they didn't may be that the seaports in the region only developed subsequently.  The caravan routes continued, but a sea trade developed that continued into the modern era -- later the lifeblood of realms like <a href="#oman">Oman</a>.  But then Oman was poorly placed to join the caravan routes in Yemen and the Hejaz.

<P>Toward the end of this period, or right at the end, depending on the chronology, the Roman Emperor <a href="romania.htm#julio">Augustus</a> is supposed to have sent an expedition down to Arabia Felix under <B>Gaius Aelius Gallus</B>.  According to Strabo, this was launched in 26 BC, but was treacherously guided by the Nabataean Syllaeus.  The Romans suffered in the desert and did not arrive until the year 24.  They were sick and wasted but nevertheless captured some cities and began besieging the city of Marsiaba.  Lack of water prevented success, however, and Gallus had to retreat.  No effort was made again to project Roman power or impose Roman sovereignty -- until Justinian found an ally nearby.

The kingdom of Saba' as the principal state of the area is followed by Himyar.  However, according to Hoyland [p.47], Saba', in "strained circumstances", formed a "united monarchy" with the Himyarite Dhu Raydan.  In the 2nd century AD, Saba' became the dominant state again, but then by the end of the 3rd had simply disappeared.  This confused process is reflected in conflicting lists from Gordon, who says of Dhu-Raydan (Zu-Raidan) that it is, "An earlier core of Himyar.  As with Saba above, this list is inconsistent with other sources for Himyar, and so I show both."  His list for Dhu-Raydan ends with Shamir Yuhar'ish III, who can be found at a similar date (c.290 AD) in the list for Himyar.  What we may have is one list of strictly Himyarite rulers, and another consisting of many from Saba', until with Shamir Yuhar'ish the Sabaean line is gone.

<P>Shamir Yuhar'ish, indeed, appears to be the first fully historical ruler in the region, and we even get absolute dating in a Himyarite Era, whose Year 1 Benchmark would have been 110 BC.  This also happens to be the era in which Abyssinia, centered at Axum, converts to Christianity (c.305 AD) and helps, at least, in ending the long running kingdom of <a href="notes/newking.htm#25">Kushite Ethiopia</a> (c.355).  Indeed, Abyssinia begins to intervene in South Arabia itself.  The list for Himyar notes an Abyssinian occupation c.310-c.378 AD.

<P>We now begin to get political events on a larger scale that impact South Arabia.  While Abyssinia, apparently, hardly needed encouragement to project its power, it got some anyway.  Its own conversion to Christianity went along with a process in which tribes and domains in Arabia converted both to Christianity and to Judaism.  A number of Yemeni Kings converted to Judaism.  This was annoying to the distant Roman Emperor <a href="romania.htm#justin">Justinian</a>, who encouraged the Ethiopians to do something about it.  The complaint was that the Yemenis were persecuting Christians, but then persecution often accompanied perceptions that Christian were agents of Rome.  Who was initially to blame for this is anyone's guess.  Under the Sassanids, <a href="armenia.htm">Armenians</a> and <a href="popes.htm#east">other Christians</a> were often suspect also.<br clear=left>

<P>The Ethiopian Emperor <a href="ethiopia.htm">Ella Asbeha</a> responded by invading Yemen, 523-525.  The occupation lasted a few years longer, and an Abyssinian governor, Abrahah, later established himself in his own right -- though Hoyland describes him as installed by the Himyarites and merely tributary to Ethiopia.  Attracting distant Roman attention, Yemen even became an object of more distant Persian interest.  According to Hoyland, discontent with Ethiopian rule (by the son of Abrahah), let to solicitations of the Sassanid Sh&acirc;h <a href="iran.htm#shahs">Khusro II</a> to intervene.  Where <a href="hist-1.htm#great">Alexander the Great</a> had planned to conquer Arabia by sea, Khusro actually did so.  At first installing his own candidate, outright conquest and Persian governors then followed (599).  With this wrapped up, Khusro <img src="images/greek/yemen.gif" align=left> (temporarily) occupied Syria, Egypt, and Asia Minor in a great (and foolish) war against Rome.  While <a href="romania.htm#heracli">Heraclius</a> defeated Khusro in the north, Persian domination in Yemen was brought to an end from a very different and portentous quarter -- the forces of the <a href="#prophet">Prophet Mu&#x1e25;ammad</a>.

<P>No more profound a change would happen in the history of Yemen and South Arabia than would now happen.  The language, the alphabet, the age old civilization of the happy South would disappear as the area would be assimilated to the ecumenical civilization of Isl&acirc;m.  Fortunately, much of what was distinctive would survive, under constant siege from Isl&acirc;m, in the daughter civilization of Ethiopia.  In its homeland, the Yemeni past would survive in legend, in ruins, and in some practices, but it would become something alien to the new values and beliefs.

<P>In the final group of Yemeni Kings, the sequence of events narrated by Hoyland does not match very well the sequence in Gordon's king list.  I have tried to tidy things up, but Hoyland's description isn't complete enough to know what all is going on in the list -- another case where I find myself frustrated and annoyed with historians who apparently don't think that their narrative histories need to be supplemented with chronological framework in tables or lists (or, when possible, genealogies).  As already noted, Hoyland's opaque reference to "lists of Sabaean rulers" raises more questions than it answers.

<P>The neglect this civilization still suffers is tragic.  Part of the problem was the self-imposed isolation of the later Yemeni Kingdom, and then many years of political instability and civil war.  Subsequently, a great deal of archaeology was undertaken, and I have noticed much more about Yemen in documentaries at places like <a href="http://www.historychannel.com/">The History Channel</a> than I have in accessible scholarly history books.  Travel was easier, despite some terrorism, and I have a friend who has inspected the ruins of the Ma'rib Dam.  I was hoping that the archaeologists in the documentaries would eventually begin to fill in the gaps, clarify the uncertainties, and in general provide definitive histories of the area.

<P>Unfortunately, civil war has returned to Yemen, drawing in Saudi Arabia on the Sunni side and <a href="iran.htm#islamic">Iran</a>, as in the days of Khusro, on the Shi'ite side.  The geopolitical stakes are high, and so that sort of conflict that no one else would pay much attention to has become a matter of international interest.

The history of Yemen under Isl&acirc;m, at first submerged in the triumphant <a href="#siege-1">Caliphates</a>, assumes a distinctive form and enters into its own characteristic history as the result of the <a href="#imams">Shi'ite</a> movement and the breakup of the <a href="#abbas">Abbasid</a> Caliphate.  The Zayd&icirc; branch of Shi'ism held that Zayd, the brother of the Fifth Im&acirc;m, al-B&acirc;qir, murdered by the Omayyad Caliph al-Hish&acirc;m, was the true Im&acirc;m.  Zayd&icirc; doctrine, nevertheless, was that the proper Im&acirc;m was not necessarily a descendant of the Prophet, but was qualified by his own personal moral and spiritual qualities.  Also, they did not believe that the Im&acirc;m possessed the divine spark and the intuition for authoritative doctrinal pronouncements that other Shi'ites believed was the mark of the Im&acirc;m.

<P>Despite this egalitarian doctrine, the Zayd&icirc; sect in Yemen began with al-Q&acirc;sim al-&#x1e24;asan&icirc;, who claimed descent from Al&icirc;'s eldest son Hassan.  During the reign of al-Ma'm&ucirc;n (813-833), Al-Q&acirc;sim moved from Medina and established himself at &#x1e62;a'da in northern Yemen.  This became the center of the Zayd&icirc; Mission, whose work (for a while) was far ranging, and in time assumed secular authority in competition with other local rulers.  Thus, the Im&acirc;ms by no means dominated Yemen.  Their rule became seriously compromised when the &#x1e62;ulay&#x1e25;id dynasty occupied &#x1e62;an'&acirc;' (which has become the modern capital of Yemen) in 1062 and then the Hamd&acirc;nids in 1171.  After 1258, the line of Im&acirc;ms continued without any political role.  Nevertheless, the Im&acirc;ms reemerged with secular authority in the later <a href="#qasimid">Q&acirc;simid</a> line.  The name of his initial line, the Rassids, derived from ar-Rass in the Hijaz, is used more by Western scholars than by Yemenis.

Just as they might have become established, Yemen suddenly became the target again of larger political events.  Forces from the powerful <a href="#ayyub">Ayy&ucirc;bid</a> dynasty of Egypt now arrive and establish a Ayy&ucirc;bid collateral line as Kings of Yemen -- though the Rassids continued to hold strategic positions, including &#x1e62;an'&acirc;' itself.  The genealogy of the Ayy&ucirc;bid Kings of Yemen is given in a popup at the Ayy&ucirc;bid entry, but for convenience I reproduce the link <a href="javascript:popup('history/ayyub-3.gif','ayyub','scrollbars,resizable,width=1025,height=848')" onMouseover="window.status='Click for Ayyubid genealogy popup';return true" onMouseout="window.status='';return true">here</a>.  It will be noted that the affinity of the second to the last king is uncertain., and that last one, al-Mas'&ucirc;d, is a son of the Sul&#x1e6d;&acirc;n of Egypt, al-K&acirc;mil I -- his own son would be the last Ayy&ucirc;bid Sul&#x1e6d;&acirc;n of Egypt.

Well before the fall of the Ayy&ucirc;bids in Egypt (1252), they are replaced in Yemen.  This is not done by a local dynasty, but by a Turkish deputy left in charge by al-Mas'&ucirc;d, who left for Syria.  A genealogy was manufactured for al-Man&#x1e63;&ucirc;r from the pre-Islamic Ghass&acirc;nids, but his family had already come to notice as Seljuk envoys (<I>ras&ucirc;l</I>) of the Abbasid Caliphs.

<P>Although, like the Ayy&ucirc;bids, the Ras&ucirc;lids were Sunnis, and we might expect local opposition of a religious nature, they nevertheless endured more than two centuries with a prosperous and culturally productive realm.  From the port of Aden trade extended as far as East Africa, India, and China.  Indeed, we arrive at the era in which <a href="sangoku.htm#ming">Chinese fleets</a> sailed in the Indian Ocean (1405-1433), and a Ras&ucirc;lid embassy to China itself is recorded.  Chinese ships undoubtedly called at Aden.  But the Chinese disappeared, soon to be followed by an equally unexpected power.

<P>The chronology of the Rassids is from Clifford Edmund Bosworth's <I>The New Islamic Dynasties</I> [Edinburgh University Press, 1996, p.96].  The subsequent Isl&acirc;mic dynasties are given by <a href="http://www.hostkingdom.net/regindex.html">Bruce R. Gordon's Regnal Chronologies</a>, which were initially transcribed but are here corrected and supplemented (as with diacritics) from Bosworth.  <I>The New Islamic Dynasties</I> gives many other local dynasties, but here I have tried to confine things to a central succession.

&nbsp;<br>The Ras&ucirc;lids are ultimately overthrown by a local, but still Sunni, family, the &#x1e6c;&acirc;hirids, a name that recalls an important family of the early days of the <a href="#tahir">Abbasids</a>.  The &#x1e6c;&acirc;hirids now witness the epic arrival of the <a href="newspain.htm">Portuguese</a> in the Indian Ocean (1498).  Afonso d'Albuquerque sieged Aden in 1513.  This alarmed the <a href="#mamluk">Maml&ucirc;ks</a>, who realized that their trade monopoly from the Mediterranean to India had been bypassed.  They began moving against Yemen in 1515 and had occupied most of the country by 1517.  Some &#x1e6c;&acirc;hirid princes survived in fortresses until 1538.  However, it was not to be the Maml&ucirc;ks who eliminated the holdouts.  Just as the Maml&ucirc;ks completed their conquest in South Arabia, Egypt itself was conquered by the <a href="turkia.htm#mehmet">Ottoman</a> Sul&#x1e6d;&acirc;n Selim I, "the Grim."  Equally alert to the Portuguese threat, the Ottomans inherited the Maml&ucirc;k position in Yemen and, for a while, vigorously enlarged it.  This also included intervention in the Horn of Africa, where the Portuguese had made contact with the long isolated Christian Emperors of <a href="ethiopia.htm">Ethiopia</a>.  Portuguese firearms, delivered after an appeal for help by the Emperor Lebna Dengel in 1535, enabled the Emperor Galawedos to defeat and kill the Im&acirc;m of Harer, A&#x1e25;mad ibn Ibrahim, at the battle of Lake Tana in 1543.  Like Ella Asbeha and Justinian many centuries earlier, in reverse, A&#x1e25;mad had been encouraged and supported by S&uuml;leym&acirc;n the Magnificent to move against Ethiopia.  After this epic event, Ottoman interest began to wane and the Turkish grip in Yemen slacken -- though they only entered &#x1e62;an'&acirc;' itself in 1547.<br clear=right>

Thus, we get the return of the Zayd&icirc; Im&acirc;ms.  At first this was as vassals of the Turks, but in short order (1635) the conquerors were ejected and Yemen achieved independence.  However, this would be an obscure and isolated independence.  Distant power again returned when the <a href="british.htm">British</a> seized Aden in 1839 to put down pirates and the slave trade.  Aden remained a British possession until 1967, and gradually a British Protectorate was extended inland and to the east.  Yemen lost its coast on the Indian Ocean.

<P>As with the early days of Sheba, there is a conflict between sources for some of the Q&acirc;simi Im&acirc;ms.  Bosworth's <I>The New Islamic Dynasties</I> [Edinburgh University Press, 1996, p.96-97] leaves out several rulers given by <a href="http://www.hostkingdom.net/regindex.html">Bruce R. Gordon's Regnal Chronologies</a> -- but also adds a few.  Where Gordon does not give diacritics or honorifics (<I>laqab</I>, like "al-Man&#x1e63;&ucirc;r"), and Bosworth creates confusion by only giving the first year of a reign, I have followed the <I>Oxford Dynasties of the World</I> by John E. Morby [Oxford University Press, 1989, 2002, p.194], which may in fact be Gordon's source, but does give diacritics and honorifics.  I have retained one feature in Bosworth, that there are two A&#x1e25;mads between 1806 and 1816, not just one.

<P>By the middle of the 19th century there are serious problems.  The Turks, despite their general lethargy, are back, and the <a href="#saudi">Wahh&acirc;b&icirc;s</a>, no doubt taking strong objection to Yemeni Shi'ism, are intervening also.  Between civil war and invasion, the Ottomans end up annexing the country again by 1871.  But, again, their rule tends to lapse into local control, and the Im&acirc;ms, whose hold on the countryside had never been entirely broken, reemerged, at least as vassals, in 1890.  This was the situation when World War I shattered Ottoman power at its source.  Yemen was simply cut loose, and the Im&acirc;m becomes the King of Yemen.

<P>After another bit of conservative and Tibetan isolation, the winds of change arrive again.  Yemen joined the Arab League in 1945 and then the United Arab Republic, with Egypt and Syria, in 1958.  Meanwhile, the substantial Jewish population of Yemen, under increasing persecution, largely decamped to Palestine and then <a href="outremer.htm#israel">Israel</a>.  The King withdrew from the UAR in 1961 but then was overthrown by the Nassarite army the following year.  As before, this did not break the power of the dynasty, and a long civil war followed, with the King supported by <a href="#saudi">Saudi Arabia</a> and <a href="#hashem">Jordan</a> and the Nassarites by, naturally, the <a href="turkia.htm#egypt">Egypt</a> of Gamal Abdel Nasser.  Nasser died in 1970, but, with 150,000 dead, the King gave up and went into exile.  Meanwhile, things got more complicated when the British left Aden in 1967.  The new People's Republic of South Yemen soon lapsed into civil war itself and was restyled the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen when the more radical Marxists, i.e. the Communists, won the war in 1970.  Bubbling with violence, the radicals kept attacking the Yemen Arab Republic, to which 300,000 refugees, disillusioned with Marxism, fled, and war broke out between them in 1979.  In 1990 this got resolved by the actual unification of North and South -- now simply known as the Republic of Yemen.  The unification came apart in another brief civil war, 1994-95, but things got patched back together again.  Although now friendly with the West, the country became the scene for one of the <a href="afghan.htm#fascism">Islamist</a> terror attacks leading up to 9/11 -- the bombing of the United States destroyer <I>Cole</I> on 12 October 2000 in Aden harbor.  Where the "Democratic Republic" had invited Soviet troops in during the 1970's, American forces now help hunt down al-Qaeda members.

<P><center><img src="images/key.gif"></center>

<P>In 2015 the secular government of Yemen was overthrown and the country is now the venue for civil war between Shi'ite forces, back by <a href="iran.htm#islamic">Iran</a>, the Sunni al-Qa'ida in the Arabian Penninsula, backed by the lunatics of <a href="afghan.htm#fascism">Islamic Fascism</a>, and the <a href="#saudi">Sa'udis</a>, with support from <a href="turkia.htm#egypt">Egypt</a> in the background, who don't want either of such forces to control the area.  The United States backs the Sa'udis, but initially tepidly, since the <a href="presiden.htm#44">Obama Administration</a> decided to further its <a href="antiam.htm">anti-American</a> and <a href="outremer.htm#israel">anti-Israeli</a> agenda by enabling the Iranian nuclear program.  The fate of Yemen thus now rides on serious Great Power problems and is a bellweather for the future of the Middle East.<br clear=left>

The <B>&Acirc;l B&ucirc; Sa'&icirc;d</B> dynasty, of Muscat, Zanzibar, and Oman, essentially exercised Arab sea power in the Indian Ocean until the domination of Europe became overwhelming.  After fighting off the Portuguese and Dutch, the Omani position was strengthened by an alliance with Britain -- which lasted until Britain withdrew from commitments East of Suez in 1967.  <B>Sa'&icirc;d ibn Sul&#x1e6d;&acirc;n</B> came to dominate the east coast of Africa south of Mogadishu, and mostly ruled from Zanzibar after 1827, permanently after 1840.  After his death the Sul&#x1e6d;&acirc;nate was divided.  The British connection proved the ultimate undoing of this empire, since Britain began to suppress the slave trade, which was the principal business of the Arabs in East Africa, and both Britain and Germany began to annex the mainland areas (Kenya and Tanganyika).  Reduced to British "protection," the Sul&#x1e6d;&acirc;ns of Zanzibar then did survive until independence, but after that were promptly overthrown.  Zanzibar was then absorbed with Tanganyika into the socialist republic of <B>Julius Nyerere</B> (1962-1985), a darling of the Left, whose harebrained economics managed to dig the country further and further into poverty all the years of his rule, despite (more like because of) some of the highest levels of foreign aid in the world.  Meanwhile, Oman was eventually cut loose by the British and emerged from Mediaeval isolation with the Sul&#x1e6d;&acirc;n still in charge.  <B>Q&acirc;b&ucirc;s ibn Sa'&icirc;d</B> is now the last <B>Sul&#x1e6d;&acirc;n</B> in the Middle East, and the last in Isl&acirc;m apart from Brunei.<br clear=left>&nbsp;

A sultanate on <img src="history/brunei.gif" align=right>the northeast coast of Borneo, and one of the wealthiest states on Earth, due to oil revenues.  Formerly in control over much of the island, it became a British Protectorate 1888-1984.  The present Sultan, one of the richest men in the world, is well known, if not infamous, for his luxuriant lifestyle.  Good looking foreign girls and women recruited for innocent sounding jobs have reported some bad experiences.

One of the stranger domains in the <a href="british.htm">British Empire</a>, perhaps the fantasy of many English boys in the 1890's.  Sarawak was granted by the Sultan of Brunei to a British adventurer, James Brooke, the "White Rajah of Sarawak," who used it as a base from which to eradicate piracy in the South China Sea and headhunting in the interior.  His successors continued as Rajahs until after the World War II, with a domain that ended up larger than the original Sultanate of Brunei.<br clear=right>

<P><img src="images/brooke.gif" align=right>Then, since the place had been so thoroughly trashed by the Japanese, C.V. Brooke ceded it to Britain.  Although the Brookes were not Moslems, their subjects were, and Sarawak eventually became part of the very Moslem country of Malaysia.

<P>When <a href="./ross/">I</a> lived in Beirut in 1969-70, one of the principal locations in the city was a large square downtown.  It was a transportation hub.  Busses and taxis left from there for Damascus and elsewhere.  The place itself was commonly called the "Bourj," <img src="images/greek/bourj.gif" align=middle>, which means "tower" -- usually written and even pronounced as though it were French.  There was no tower, but evidently there had been, and the name had stuck.  The <I>official</I> name was the "Places des Martyrs," which at the time seemed to be about something else equally non-existent, since my fellow students and I could not imagine what kind of "martyrs" there ever could have been in Lebanese history.

<P>As it turned out, there were indeed martyrs, but it was not just in Lebanese history.  On August 21, 1915, eleven suspected Arab nationalist leaders were hung on that very site in Beirut, oddly called "Liberty Square" at the time, by the Turkish military authorities, under Jemal Pasha.  On May 6, 1916, the Turks executed twenty-one others, seven in Damascus and fourteen in Beirut.

<P><img src="history/islam-07.gif" align=right>On hearing the news of the latter, <B>Prince Fay&#x1e63;al</B>, son of the <B>Shar&icirc;f &#x1e24;usayn</B> of Mecca, who was visiting near Damascus, is supposed to have thrown down his headress and exclaimed, "Death has become sweet, Oh Arabs!"  Fay&#x1e63;al returned to Mecca, and the Arab Revolt against the Turks, long in preparation by Fay&#x1e63;al's father, commenced on the 5th of June.

<P>Prince Fay&#x1e63;al and the Shar&icirc;f &#x1e24;usayn were <B>Hashemites</B>, i.e. were supposed to be descendants of the Prophet Mu&#x1e25;ammad.  At right is the complete genealogy of this descent, as reported by the family itself.  I have derived this from a curious source, a book called <I>A Prince of Arabia, the Amir Shereef Ali Haider</I>, by George Stitt [George Allen & Unwin, London, 1948 -- this is from the personal historical library of my friend Tom Dunlap].  Ali Haider was from the senior or Zaidi branch of the Hashemite family, who had supplied most of the Amirs or Sharifs of Mecca until 1882, when the junior or 'Awni branch took over.  When &#x1e24;usayn revolted against the Turks in 1916, Ali Haider was appointed in his place by the Ottoman Sult&acirc;n.  Ali Haider was never able to go to Mecca and exercised no real authority under the Turks.  His son did end up marrying the granddaughter of the Ottoman Sult&acirc;n Murad V (1876).  Histories of the period or the area rarely mention him.  Unfortunately, the book about him from 1948 uses Anglicized versions of the Arabic names.  I have not supplied the proper transcriptions for all the names.  Other information here is from Clifford Edmund Bosworth, <I>The New Islamic Dynasties</I> [Edinburgh University Press, 1996], and from George Antonius, <I>The Arab Awakening</I> [1946, Capricorn Books, New York, 1965]. 

<P>The romance of the Arab Revolt, with Lawrence of Arabia and all, and its success in sweeping all the way to Damascus, as the British advanced into Palestine, came to be fully balanced by bitterness at the British betrayal of assurances for Arab independence after the war.  The British had made promises elsewhere, to the French and to the Zionists, and not a lot of care had been taken in the desperate days of the war to keep all these undertakings consistent with each other.  Initially, the worse betrayal seemed to be over Syria.  With Fay&#x1e63;al in possession of Damascus, he was elected King of Syria in 1920; but in short order the French, to whom the British had handed control of Lebanon, as they had honestly warned the Arabs they would, moved in force to occupy Damascus and the rest of Syria, which the British had agreed with them, but not with the Arabs, that they could do.  Fay&#x1e63;al was tossed out.  The French commemorated this victory by carving a stele in the rock at the Nahr al-Kalb (the Dog River) in Lebanon, joining earlier stelae by the Egyptians, Assyrians, and others.  After the Vichy French were overthrown in Lebanon and Syria, in turn, in World War II, the stele naturally was attacked and mutilated beyond recognition.

The British sense of fair play in such circumstances manifested itself as a desire to compensate individuals.  There was rarely a sense in British policy that popular sentiment might be something to reckon with.  Thus, Fay&#x1e63;al was personally compensated with the throne of Iraq, which for a decade was maintained as a British Mandate.  This may or may not have reconciled Fay&#x1e63;al to all that had happened.  But it certainly did not reconcile his father, the old Shar&icirc;f of Mecca, now King of the &#x1e24;ij&acirc;z, &#x1e24;usayn.  Nothing could reconcile &#x1e24;usayn to what had happened, and his attitude resulted in a dangerous break with the British -- very dangerous for &#x1e24;usayn because his ambitious neighbor, <B>Ibn Sa'&ucirc;d</B>, remained on good terms with the British and was supported by subsidies.

<P>One of &#x1e24;usayn's other sons, <B>'Abdull&acirc;h</B>, even led a small force north, evidently to contest Syria with the French.  However, before 'Abdull&acirc;h crossed the French border, he was persuaded that perhaps he should stay where he was, just across the Jordan River, in a area of vague jurisdiction.  This was at the time considered part of Syria, but the French evidently had no use for it, and its proximity to Palestine put it more or less in the British sphere of influence.  So 'Abdull&acirc;h settled down as the Am&icirc;r of the Transjordan, filling in the space between British Palestine and British Iraq.

<P>This did not improve the humor of 'Abdull&acirc;h's father, whose leadership turned out to be not much better than his diplomacy.  When <B>Kemal Attat&uuml;rk</B> abolished the <a href="turkia.htm#turks">Ottoman Caliphate</a> in 1924 (the Sul&#x1e6d;&acirc;nate had already been abolished in 1922), &#x1e24;usayn decided that if it was anyone's business to be Caliph, it was his.  Indeed, the last <I>bona fide</I> <a href="#mamluk">Abbasid</a> Caliph had been carted off to Constantinople in 1517, and it was only after three hundred years or so that the Ottoman Sul&#x1e6d;&acirc;ns began to claim that the office had been passed on to them.  This unlikely and irregular transmission, however, eventually came to be accepted by many Moslems, and the abolition of the office left Isl&acirc;m without <I>somebody</I> to claim it for the first time in Isl&acirc;mic history.  From a dynasty that had served as the Guardians of the Holy Cities for some time, and which was accepted as belonging to the Hashimite clan of the Prophet himself, it must have seemed quite reasonable to &#x1e24;usayn, as it still seems fairly reasonable in retrospect, that the office should fall to him.

<P>At the time, however, nobody was buying this, and &#x1e24;usayn's reputation was badly damaged.  Ibn Sa'&ucirc;d and his Wahhabi fundamentalists began protesting and threatening, and &#x1e24;usayn had put himself in no good position to resist them.  When <I>consensus</I> is so important in the tradition of Isl&acirc;mic Law, &#x1e24;usayn would have been better advised to first solicit opinions from respected jurists about whether there needed to be a Caliph, who would be appropriate for it, etc.  In 1925 he abdicated in favor of his eldest son <B>'Al&icirc;</B>, but this did not stop Ibn Sa'&ucirc;d.  The &#x1e24;ij&acirc;z soon joined the Sa'&ucirc;d&icirc; central Arabian domain of Najd in the new <B>Kingdom of Sa'&ucirc;d&icirc; Arabia</B>.  Then Ibn Sa'&ucirc;d's British subsidies soon gave way to income of a different sort, when vast oil reserves were discovered under the Arabian sands.  But &#x1e24;usayn and 'Al&icirc; could only flee to the welcome of 'Abdull&acirc;h's court in the Transjordan to live out the rest of their lives.

<P>Britain's other conflicting promises, over Palestine, prepared the way for the most dangerous and intractable problem in all of 20th Century politics, diplomacy, and war, as Jewish colonists sought, and achieved, the creation of a Jewish State, Israel, in Palestine.  The best showing by an Arab army in the 1948 war was, ironically, the British commanded Arab Legion of 'Abdull&acirc;h, at that point King of the Transjordan.  Yet 'Abdull&acirc;h had no particular animus against either Jews or Zionists, and rumor maintains that in a secret meeting with Golda Meir he actually proposed some kind of condominium over Palestine between the Zionists and himself.  This was rejected, but then 'Abdull&acirc;h subsequently annexed the Palestinian territory that he ended up occupying, creating simply the <B>Kingdom of (the) Jordan</B>.  Since the Palestinian fire-eaters were all ready to found their own radical Palestinian republic in the land preserved from Israel, this move earned 'Abdull&acirc;h his own assassination.  Now, ironically, by conquering Jordanian Palestine in 1967, the Israelis have ended up with the fire-eaters in their own house, setting off bombs.

<P>The throne of Jordan soon passed over 'Abdull&acirc;h's mentally incompetent son &#x1e6c;al&acirc;l to his grandson <B>&#x1e24;usayn</B>.  In 1999, &#x1e24;usayn, having endured every war, revolution, and upheaval since, died after a long fight with cancer.  Thus passed a man of astonishing durability in the merciless politics of the Middle East, although hated by many Arabs for his suppression of armed Palestinian organizations in Jordan (in "Black September").  &#x1e24;usayn, the namesake of his great-grandfather and eyewitness to his grandfather's assassination, was the last living link to the Arab Revolt.  Although he was long denigrated as a reactionary, who wasn't in tune with all the great new Marxist Arab Nationalism of the 50's, 60's, and 70's, &#x1e24;usayn survived into a era when it is hard to tell the Marxists from the Muj&acirc;hid&ucirc;n (Isl&acirc;mic fighters in the Holy War), and where the folly of each is, or should be, fairly obvious.  To everyone's surprise, &#x1e24;usayn had, just a couple weeks before his death, disinherited his brother &#x1e24;assan, the Crown Prince for 34 years, and left the Throne to his son 'Abdull&acirc;h, who thus becomes King <B>'Abdull&acirc;h II</B> of Jordan.  (One hopes this was not entirely a surprise to &#x1e24;assan.)  &#x1e24;usayn's second cousin, King <B>Fay&#x1e63;al II</B> of Iraq, unfortunately, was overthrown and murdered in 1958, sending Iraq down a path to a despotism which it was doomed to long endure.  Only now, in 2003, after three wars, has the dictator of Iraq, Saddam Hussein, been overthrown, thanks to an American and British invasion of the country.

<P>The 1st Gulf War was initiated by Hussein in 1980, hoping to seize the east bank of the Shatt-al-'Arab (the confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates) from <a href="iran.htm#pahlavi">Ir&acirc;n</a>, whose military had been weakened by purges of the Shah's officers.  By 1982 the Iranians managed, with suicidal "human wave" attacks, to throw Hussein back, and he was willing to call it quits; but the Ayatollah Khomeini refused to let up.  It didn't do much good, and, even though Khomeini said he would rather "drink poison," he finally accepted a ceasefire in 1988.  The 2nd Gulf War was initiated by Hussein in 1990, invading and occupying Kuwait.  Just a year later a coalition of American, Arab, and European forces threw Hussein out of Kuwait.  Although warned that it might precipitate a global ecological disaster, Hussein ordered the torching of over 600 oil wells as Iraqi forces retreated from Kuwait.  Fortunately, although it was a terrible mess, the disaster was of more limited consequence.  Iraqi territory itself was not occupied, and revolts by Shi'ites in the south of Iraq and Kurds in the north were brutally suppressed by Hussein.  Iraq subsequently was under UN sanctions until the destruction of its nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons programs could be certified.  American and British air power patrolled "no fly zones" in the north and south of the country.  This didn't really make much difference in the south, but in the north it protected what had become an autonomous Kurdish domain.  UN inspectors could not certify that Hussein had destroyed his unconventional weapons, and they even left the country in 1998 after Iraqi non-cooperation.  In 2003, the 3rd Gulf War was initiated by the United States and Britain, principally, with the determination, apparently, that it was simply high time to resolve the matter and get rid of Hussein -- especially after the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United States.  Hussein was overthrown, later captured, tried, and finally executed -- shamefully taunted at his hanging by Shi'ite executioners.

<P>Iraq itself, however, although now (2007) with a democratically elected government, in which all groups managed to participate, nevertheless is a place of constant violence.  The Sunni minority, with Baathist diehards, began an "uprising" rather than live under governments dominated by the Shi'ite majority.  Although this is portrayed, often by Western sympathizers, as a national struggle against American occupation, most of the casualties have been civilian victims of suicide bombers and car bombs.  There have also been attacks against Islamic sites, like the Golden Mosque in Samara, which was associated with Shi'ism.  These tactics in part are the inspiration of al-Qa'ida and effected by an influx of foreign Jihadists.  Substantial parts of the Sunni community are now tiring of this, especially since the Shi'ites have answered in kind, with help from the Shi'ite motherland, Iran.  Since the Shi'ites and Iran have little more sympathy for America than they do for the Sunnis, American (and British) forces tend to get caught in the middle.  Nevertheless, it is the interest of the West, the International Community, and Iraq that neither Sunnis nor Shi'ites have an outright victory, and the only way to prevent that and mediate a settlement is for a third party (the Americans) to maintain the balance.  Meanwhile, the Kurds, although provoking Turkey by supporting Kurdish terrorists there, have been relatively safe and prosperous in their part of Iraq -- now behind a dike to inhibit terrorist infiltration.  They have even paid for commercials on American television with thanks for American efforts.  With many in American politics cynically and opportunistically hoping to benefit from a defeat in Iraq, however, as they benefited from defeat in <a href="perigoku.htm#viet">Vietnam</a> (along with Isolationists and simple anti-American <a href="rand.htm#modern">Leftists</a>), those efforts may not continue much longer.  Meanwhile, all the major communities seem to have joined in an ethnic purge of Iraqi Christians, the <a href="popes.htm#syrian">Syrian Orthodox</a> and Catholics, <a href="popes.htm#east">Chaldeans and Assyrians</a>.  As with the persecution of Christians anywhere, this draws little attention from the Western Press (whose template is that Christians are as bad as Muslim Jihadists), and the numbers of Iraqi Christians are too small to figure in most geopolitical calculations.

<P>The whole area around the Bourj in Beirut was destroyed in the Lebanese civil war of the 70's and 80's.  Plenty of new martyrs were created, though it is not clear what the <I>cause</I> was supposed to be when the Lebanese largely destroyed their own country and slaughtered each other, opening the door to a Syrian occupation of much of the country, something that no Lebanese of any faction really wanted.  After some years of relative peace, chaos has returned as Syria evidently continues to promote its interests (starting with key assassinations) and both radicalized Shi'ites and Sunni Jihadists display little desire to live peaceful, ordinary lives.

Morocco continues more or less as it had from the Middle Ages, even exerting some influence south of the Sahara.  As the Turkish presence waned in Algeria, Tunisia and Tripolitania, the area lapsed into a chaos of small states, whose principal business became piracy and slaving.  This provoked the occasional sharp response from the European powers, but nothing got settled until in 1830 the French arrived to subdue Algeria.  This ended the piracy and makes Algeria the most important French colony for the next 132 years, with a large population of French colonial farmers, the <I>pieds noirs</I>.

While colonialism became the <I>b&ecirc;te noire</I> of <a href="marx.htm">Marxism</a>, 
the problem of these French colonials wracked France, brought down the <a href="francia.htm#4rep">Fourth Republic</a>, and provoked an attempted coup against the founder of the Fifth Republic, Charles de Gaulle.

<P>From the colonial foundation of Algeria, France began to lean on Morocco and Tunisia.  As Britain embarked on a long term occupation of <a href="turkia.htm#egypt">Egypt</a> in 1882, France, which had backed off joining the British move, consolidated control over Tunisia instead.  The &#x1e24;usaynid Beys then lasted, as French clients, all the way to independence.  Briefly, it looked like the dynasty might survive independence, but the nationalist leader, <B>Habib Bourgiba</B> (&#x1e24;ab&icirc;b B&ucirc; Ruqayba), in the tradition of many other familiar dictators, did not need a tradtionalistic rival to his authority.

<P>The Moroccan experience was different.  While France moved steadily to consolidate its influence, this was not without complaint from other European powers.  World War I nearly started early with the Agadir incident in 1911, as Germany's Kaiser <a href="francia.htm#second">Wilhelm II</a> offered hope that Germany would dispute any French designs on the Sult&acirc;nate.  As it happened, the War waited a couple more years and a French Protectorate was nevertheless imposed in 1912.  Morocco then later became the scene of the mythic presence of "Rick" in the classic movie <I>Casblanca</I>, not far from the real life drama of American troops landing in November 1942, to precipitate French North Africa back into World War II against Germany.  The Germans chased out, Morocco became the first French possession to regain independence, not in the dangerous grip of nationalist ideology, but still under the control of the traditional monarchy, the only such traditional national monarchy surviving in the Arab world from the Middle Ages.

<P>Tripoli drifted into autonomy under a Janissary commander, A&#x1e25;mad Qaram&acirc;nl&icirc;, whose name drives from some association of his or his ancestors with the former Turkish state of <a href="mongol.htm#qaraman">Qaram&acirc;n</a> in Anatolia.  We also have the nice touch of the <a href="italia.htm#naples">Greek</a> origin of the name "Tripoli," whose Arabic form, for Libya, was <img src="images/greek/al-gharb.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/trabulus.gif" align=middle>, <I>&#x1e6c;ar&acirc;bulus al-Gharb</I>, "Tripoli of the West" (as opposed to Tripoli in Lebanon).  These are the rulers who ran afoul of <a href="presiden.htm#3">Thomas Jefferson</a> and the United States Marines.  After paying $2,000,000 in "tribute" extortion money, Jefferson had had enough and in 1801 sent the U.S. Navy and Marines against Tripoli.  This brought at least a temporary respite, and contributed a phrase ("the shores of Tripoli") to the Marine Hymn.  Backing off of American shipping, the <a href="rank.htm#turkish">Beys</a> were done in when the Turkish government became alarmed over the French occupation of Algeria in 1830.  To forestall any French move against Tripoli, the Turks reasserted their authority, although the <a href="turkia.htm#libya">San&ucirc;s&icirc; Am&icirc;rs</a> began to drift into autonomy again.

<P>Morocco and Tunisia now look like islands of bliss in comparison to Algeria, where dictatorship was supposed to end with elections, but then, when the elections went to Isl&acirc;mic fundamentalists, the army set them aside in favor of a more moderate dictatorship.  The result has been a particularly nasty kind of civil war, in which whole villages have been massacred by forces that don't even acknowledge which side they are fighting for.  This frightening and perplexing dilemma is beginning to seem all too common in the Isl&acirc;mic world, where the most vicious radicals nevertheless seem to command genuine popularity and prestige.  It is thus an example of the challenge of <a href="afghan.htm#fascism">Islamic Fascism</a> that is beginning to characterize our era.

The central lands of the Arabian peninsula, the <I>Najd</I> ("highland, upland"), is not a place of much significance in world history -- until recently.  The House of Su'&ucirc;d has made it significant.  At first this was just for religious reasons.  The amirs allied themselves with a fundamentalist religious movement, the <I>Wahh&acirc;b&icirc;s</I>; and at the beginning of the 19th century, they began to trouble the Ottoman authorities at Mecca and Medina for the insufficient orthodoxy and purity of their institutions.  Since the Wahhabis did not believe that graves should be marked, lest individuals receive respect and devotion that is only owing to God, even the Prophet's Tomb in Medina was not above suspicion.  The threat became so serious that the Sul&#x1e6d;&acirc;n asked <a href="turkia.htm#egypt">Mu&#x1e25;ammad 'Al&icirc;</a> of Egypt to intervene.  The Su'&ucirc;d&icirc;s were sharply defeated and driven out of the Hijaz (1818).  The job, however, had to be done all over again twenty years later (1838).  This time the Egyptians maintained indirect control for a few years subsequently.  Freed from Egyptian control, the Su'&ucirc;dis soon were more permanently subordinated to other Arabian princes, the Rash&icirc;d&icirc;s.

<P>The realm was permanently liberated from outside control by a formidable ruler, 'Abd al-'Az&icirc;z (II) ibn Su'&ucirc;d.  In his long reign (1902-1952), 'Abd al-'Az&icirc;z transformed the fortunes of his realm, by diplomacy, by war, and by extraordinary good fortune.  Thus, a cash subsidy from the British meant that he was in the right place and at the right time to take advantage of the falling out between the British and the new king <a href="#hashem">&#x1e24;ussayn</a> of the Hijaz, the erstwhile leader of the Arab revolt against the Turks in World War I.  By deposing &#x1e24;usayn in 1925, 'Abd al-'Az&icirc;z was soon able to unify the central Arabian Peninsula from the Persian Gulf right across to the Red Sea.  This then became the Kingdom of <B>Sa'&ucirc;d&icirc; Arabia</B>.  Before long the British subsidies were no longer necessary, since the discovery of vast oil reserves in the Persian Gulf soon brought in wealth such as the bare lands of Arabia had never seen before.  The Najdi capital of Riyadh was at first so miserable that foreign embassies had been confined to Jiddah.  Now "Arab" became a byword for "wealth."

<P>Despite incredible wealth, kicked into overdrive by the Arab oil boycott in 1973, Sa'&ucirc;d&icirc; Arabia remained deeply conservative and religiously fundamentalist, as in the early days of the Wahh&acirc;b&icirc;s.  Alcohol is prohibited in the Kingdom.  Women cannot drive cars without the company of a man.  Nor can women work in mixed company or appear on television without a veil.  The full rigors of Isl&acirc;mic law mean that fornication (let alone adultery) can be punished by death (beheading) and theft by the amputation of a hand.  A special religious police force looks after moral improprieties, including even excessive laughter in one's home.

<P>The rigors of Isl&acirc;m, however, did not necessarily strike other Arabs as the most objectionable thing about Sa'&ucirc;d&icirc; Arabia.  Revolutions in Iraq, Syria, and especially Egypt, with promulgation of ideologies like Nasser's "Arab socialism," led to the desire and expectation that the "reactionary regimes," i.e. monarchies and pro-Western governments, would eventually all be swept away.  The Sa'&ucirc;d&icirc;s had some natural advantages against this.  'Abd al-'Az&icirc;z begat literally dozens of children, and this formed a tight family corporation for the control of the country.  At the same time, the Nasserites and socialists, by their close association with the Soviet Union, handed the Sa'&ucirc;d&icirc;s a powerful card:  &nbsp;the atheism of the Communists, of no particular concern to Nasser, was anathema to the fundamentalists.  For many years beyond the time it made the slightest bit of sense, the Kingdom always linked Israel and the Soviets as the twin pillars of Communist atheism.

<P>In more institutional terms, since a military coup was always the most serious threat to a Middle Eastern state, the Sa'&ucirc;d&icirc;s created two entirely separate military establishments, the regular military and a national guard, that could serve as checks on each other.  The Kingdom thus rode out the high tide of Arab revolution.  As Egypt and Jordan made peace with Israel, and then Iraq threatened the Sa'&ucirc;d&icirc;s with a surprise conquest of Kuwait (another "reactionary" Emirate), the Kingdom found itself in a grand alliance of Egypt, Syria, Britain, France, and the United States to liberate Kuwait.  Meanwhile, a threat to the Sa'&ucirc;d&icirc;s had come from a very different kind of revolution, the <a href="iran.htm#pahlavi">Iranian</a> upheaval of the Ayatollah Khomeini.  With the beginning of the <a href="calendar.htm#nabo">Islamic year</a> 1400, in December 1979, Iranian inspired fanatics took over the Great Mosque in Mecca, which houses the <B>Ka'aba</B>, the House of God, built by Abraham, the most sacred place in all of Isl&acirc;m.  A bloody firefight, damaging the building, was necessary to defeat the fanatics.  Henceforth, Iranians were closely watched and controlled while on pilgrimage (nothing new, actually, in Orthodox Mecca, where Richard Burton, impersonating a Moslem, observed much the same thing in the 19th century).

<P>In 2001, the Sa'&ucirc;d&icirc;s, still ruled by <a href="javascript:popup('history/saudi.gif','sons','resizable,scrollbars,width=1025,height=400')" onMouseover="window.status='Click for chart of the sons of ibn Saud popup';return true" onMouseout="window.status='';return true">sons of 'Abd al-'Az&icirc;z</a> (he had 43 or more of them, from 1900 to 1947), seemed secure enough.  When OPEC drives up oil prices, the Kingdom wins browny points with the West (and makes extra money) by underselling Cartel prices.  Conservative Isl&acirc;m is under no threat from any non-Western sources, though the occasional wild Prince, like the one with the nude statuary with painted pubic hair at his house in Beverly Hills, must be intensely embarrassing.  I always wonder about the Sa'&ucirc;d&icirc; girls I knew in Beirut in 1969-1970, who used to change into see-through blouses on the flights from Jiddah to Beirut.  Either they live a private life secure from the religious police (police invasions of domestic privacy common in the West would provoke serious bloodshed in Arabia), or they have moved to the West.  As conservative guardians of the Holy Cities of Isl&acirc;m, Sa'&ucirc;d&icirc; Arabia is probably in an ideologically position stronger than for most of the 20th century.  Isl&acirc;m everywhere has tended to gravitate toward the Wahh&acirc;b&icirc; positions, rather than away from them.

<P>The terrorist attacks against the United States on 9/11/2001 put conservative Isl&acirc;m in a somewhat different light.  Sa'&ucirc;d&icirc; subsidies to Islamic schools in countries like Pakistan have helped breed a generation of fanatics with a great hatred of modernity and the West.  The mastermind of the 9/11 attacks, Osama ben Ladin, was himself a Sa'&ucirc;d&icirc; millionaire, stripped of his citizenship, who had created a state-within-a-state in &#x1e6c;&acirc;lib&acirc;n <a href="afghan.htm">Afghanistian</a>.  <I>&#x1e6c;&acirc;lib&acirc;n</I> itself ominously means "students," i.e. students from the Pakistani Isl&acirc;mic schools.  The Sa'&ucirc;d&icirc;s are (officially) mortified by all this; but many Americans, particularly but not exclusively those sympathetic to <a href="outremer.htm#israel">Israel</a>, are suddenly suspicious of a presumably friendly regime whose consistent actions have tended, not surprisingly, to promote anti-Americanism.  There is undoubtedly an inner inconistency in Sa'&ucirc;d&icirc; policy, which is overtly friendly, indeed dependent (with American troups stationed in the country), with the country whose culture represents the whole threat of freedom and modernity to Wahh&acirc;b&icirc; conservatism and the theocratic aspect of the Sa'&ucirc;d&icirc; state.  Where previously the threat to the Sa'&ucirc;d&icirc; state had been from the Left, things like Nasser's "Arab Socialism," now the threat may be from the Right, from people who view any remnant of secular pragmatism and <I>Realpolitik</I> in Sa'&ucirc;d&icirc; policy as irreligious -- the people who have created the present ideology of <a href="afghan.htm#fascism">Islamic Fascism</a>.  This is an unusual position for the House of Su'&ucirc;d, and it may force some unpleasant choices upon them.

<P>The death of King 'Adball&acirc;h in 2015 meant that the resevoir of sons of 'Abd al-'Az&icirc;z is beginning to run dry.  The Crown Prince, Muqrin, at 69, is now the youngest surviving son.  His successor will be from the next generation of Su'&ucirc;d&icirc;s, already designated as the Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed, son of Prince Nayef.  In updating the page here for these changes, I noticed that my previous source, Robert Lacey's <I>The Kingdom, Arabia & the House of Sa'ud</I> [Avon Books, 1981, 1982] actually failed to include the new King, Salman, among the sons of 'Abd al-'Az&icirc;z.  Also, consulting Wikipedia and other sources, the birth dates for several Princes are different from those given by Lacey.  I do not know if the problems with Lacey were his own carelessness or the difficulty of getting accurate information out of the Su'&ucirc;d&icirc;s.  I have made some corrections but have not examined the dates and names for all the Princes.  Many have died whose fate I have not yet recorded.

<P>The paradox of the position of the Su'&ucirc;d&icirc;s continues.  Whether we call it <a href="afghan.htm#fascism">Islamic Fascism</a>, Radical Islam, Terrorism, Islamism, Jihadism, or whatever, the Su'&ucirc;d&icirc;s are themselves responsible the promotion of the reactionary and fundamentalist ideas that have fueled it.  Yet they are alarmed and threatened by the result.  <img src="images/obama.jpg" align=right>The "Arab Spring," with the promise of democratization, was as much as threat to Su'&ucirc;d&icirc; autocracy as it was to any other regime, but the collapse of the "Spring" into chaos, civil war, or radicalization everywhere except Tunisia has actually given the Su'&ucirc;d&icirc;s some breathing room.  No sensible person wants the Monarchy overthrown just to end up with a bunch of raging Jihadists.

<P>Of course, in that respect, one wonders about the policy of <a href="presiden.htm#44">Barack Obama</a>, whose tepid support for allies like both <a href="outremer.htm#israel">Israel</a> and Saudi Arabia, and his apparent eagerness to strike even a bad nuclear deal with radical <a href="iran.htm#islamic">Iran</a>, make one wonder about his commitment and even his intentions.  After his infamous bow to King 'Abdall&acirc;h, many wonder now if Obama has simply lost interest because of the complexity and intractability of the situation.  He continues to boast of withdrawing American forces from both Iraq and Afghanistan, beyond the point where this seemed prudent -- as it definitely proved not to be in Iraq when the "Islamic State" (ISIS or ISIL) captured Mosul and much of the rest of the country in 2014.  The Iraqi Army, purged of Sunnis, broke and fled, while the Kurds were stuck with a desperate Goal Line Defense.  After foolish dithering, Obama agreed to some airstrikes and adivsors, but the Kurds were still not receiving direct military aid.  Rumors float that Israel and the Su'&ucirc;d&icirc;s are secretly planning what to do about Iran's nuclear program if Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry sell everyone out to Iran.  Many are surprised that Israel has not already struck Iran's nuclear facilities, as it previously has attacked such things in both Iraq, under Hussein, and Syria, more recently.  The number of nuclear sites and their exteme range make it a difficult <a href="rank.htm#ops">operation</a> for the Israeli Air Force.  It would all be a lot easier if the Su'&ucirc;d&icirc;s provided bases and support.  Yet that probably could only be done secretly.  Saudi Arabia cannot openly side with Israel at a time when pure hatred of Jews may be at its highest in the Islamic world.  A feudal anachronism of desert sheiks thus continues to walk a thin line as a major player in 21st century politics.<br clear=right>
