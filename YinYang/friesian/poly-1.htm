and the ugly can be produced through morally right action or be itself good in a non-moral sense.  This sort of theory, at first of "ideal" non-moral ethics, was originally suggested by the poet, playwright, and historian <B>J.C. Friedrich von Schiller</B> (1759-1805), as a correction to the <a href="poly-1b.htm#moralism">moralism</a> of <a href="moral-1.htm#note-1">Kant's</a> ethics, and was more recently advocated and developed by <B>Leonard Nelson</B> (1882-1927), in his <I>System der Ethik</I>, 1932 [<I>System of Ethics</I>, Yale, 1956].  It is thus part of the heritage and patrimony of the <a href="school.htm">Friesian School</a>.

<P><a name="axios">Some commentators, especially conservative <a href="nullif.htm#dread">culture warriors</a>, don't like the contemporary use of the term "value."  They apparently think that it is introduced, especially in <a href="public.htm">education</a>, to replace stronger terminology like "right and wrong" and to promote <a href="relative.htm">Relativism</a>.  They may even be right about that, but this does not mean that the term "value" is actually without, well, value.  Its Latinate derviation (<I>valuta</I>) does not give it the same punch as words from Old English; but its source, the verb <I>vale&ocirc;</I> (<I>val&ecirc;re, valu&icirc;, valitus/valutus</I>), has an impressive range of meanings, to be "strong, powerful, worth, healthy," etc.  We also get <I>val&ecirc;t&ucirc;do</I> and <I>validus</I>, which are familiar from other English derivatives, and the name of the Emperor <a href="romania.htm#valentin">Valens</a>, "Strong," who, unfortunately, wasn't strong enough to win against the <a href="germania.htm#visigoths">Goths</a> at the Battle of Adrianople (378 AD) [<a href="#note-00">note</a>].

<P>The Old English derived cognate of "value," which is "<B>worth</B>" (German <I>Wert</I>), is a perfectly useful alternative word in its own right.  Things have worth; but it is the <I>general</I> meaning of "value" and "worth" that is appropriate for the Polynomic Theory.  <I>Shoes</I> have value and worth; but, without tortured formulations, they do not have <I>moral</I> value or worth.  If we are among the modern Nihilists who do not believe that morality exists, this is a useful circumstance.  <a href="poly-2.htm#nietzsche">Nietzsche</a> sought to replace moral value with aesthetic value -- the fallacy of <a href="poly-1b.htm#text-8">moral aestheticism</a>.  But even if morality exists, not all value is moral value, and aesthetic value is not moral value -- and this is the issue to be addressed here.

<P><img src="images/legs-g.gif" align=left>In Greek, "value" or "worth" would be <img src="images/greek/axia.gif" align=middle>, <I>ax&iacute;a</I>.  As an adjective, "worthy," it would be <img src="images/greek/axios.gif" align=middle>, <I>&aacute;xios</I> (compare, "axiom," <img src="images/greek/axiom.gif" align=middle>, plural <img src="images/greek/axioms.gif" align=middle>, <I>axi&oacute;mata</I>), which figures in the word <img src="images/greek/axiology.gif" align=middle>, <I>axiolog&iacute;a</I>, i.e. "axiology," the <a href="value.htm">theory of value</a>, which is generally understood to embrace ethics, aesthetics, meta-ethics, religion, jurisprudence, etc. -- although the term actually doesn't get used all that much.

<P>When the citizens of <a href="decdenc1.htm#constantinople">Constantinople</a> began to think that it was time to depose an Emperor of <a href="romania.htm">Romania</a>, they would begin to shout <img src="images/greek/unworthy.gif" align=middle>, <I>an&aacute;xios</I>, "unworthy!"  Unlike Western Europe, or <a href="francia.htm">Francia</a>, where few Mediaeval rulers were overthrown by popular revolt, this was not unusual in the "Great City," the <a href="romania.htm#arrival">Norse</a> <I>Miklagard</I>, on the Bosporus.  Similarly, rebels or candidates for the Throne might be promoted as <img src="images/greek/axios.gif" align=middle>, "worthy."

<P>At this website, I have begun using <img src="images/greek/unworthy.gif" align=middle> and, to a lesser extent, <img src="images/greek/axios.gif" align=middle> as icons to mark politicians, or those with some chance (or threat) of soon entering politics, for the value, negative or positive, respectively, of their contribution or ideology.  In our day and age, there are few politicians who are not <img src="images/greek/unworthy.gif" align=middle>, just as Socrates discovered when he began to <a href="apology.htm#reputed">examine</a> those of his day.

<P><a name="text-10">"Axiology" is a modern neologism.  It does not occur in the unabridged Liddell and Scott Greek lexicon, or even in my Modern Greek dictionary.  It does not even occur in the 1971 edition of the <I>Compact Oxford English Dictionary</I>.  Indeed, Merriam-Webster asserts that the "first known use" of "axiology," <I>axiologie</I> in French, was in 1891.  <I>Axiologie</I> is then attested in the French philosopher Paul Lapie (1869-1927) in 1902; and we then get the <I>Grundriss der Axiologie</I> (<I>Outline of Axiology</I>, 1909) by Eduard von Hartmann (1842-1906).

<P>However, another word does occur in the Greek dictionaries, <img src="images/greek/axiologo.gif" align=middle>, <I>axi&oacute;logos</I>, glossed by Liddell and Scott as "worthy of mention, remarkable."  The noun, <img src="images/greek/axiology.gif" align=middle>, derivative of the same meaning, could easily exist; and for a while I thought it was attested in the <I>De Ceremoniis</I> of the Emperor <a href="romania.htm#macedon">Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus</a> (913-959), in a section "Acclamation of the demes at a coronation of an emperor," and others [<a href="#note-10">note</a>].  But the actual word there for "<a href="rank.htm#note-6">acclamation</a>" is <img src="images/greek/actology.gif" align=middle>, also unattested in the lexicons, but perhaps derived from the same root, <img src="images/greek/lead.gif" align=middle> (<I>&aacute;g&ocirc;</I>, "lead"), as <img src="images/greek/actor.gif" align=middle>, <I>&aacute;kt&ocirc;r</I>, "leader."  I think <img src="images/greek/axiology.gif" align=middle> would have been more suitable.  The sense of <img src="images/greek/actology.gif" align=middle> as to "speak of a leader," is parallel to <img src="images/greek/eulogy.gif" align=middle>, "eulogy," to "speak well" of someone, at their funeral.  But for an acclamation, they should be very much alive.

<P>The Chinese character for "value" is <img src="images/hiero/value.gif" align=middle>.  This means just "price" as well as value, and the Chinese uses tend to revolve around monetary value.  However, in Japanese, where the character is read <I>ka</I> or <I>atai</I>, we get the broader semantics of "price, cost, value, worth" and even "merit," and the usage seems to match <img src="images/greek/axios.gif" align=middle> or "value" in English.  On this page and elsewhere, the value terminology found in Chinese chararacters is cited extensively, with some discussion of ambiguities, as with the "good" of <img src="images/hiero/good.gif" align=middle> contrasted with that of <img src="images/hiero/good3.gif" align=middle>, where the latter narrows to <I>moral</I> goodness.

<P>The <I>wrap-around</I> feature of the diagram indicates the generality of the term "good."  The morally right is an ethical good, <a href="poly-2.htm#log"><img src="images/square-p.gif" align=right border=0></a>and both moral and non-moral ethical goodness are good and beautiful -- an expression the Greeks combined into one word, <I>kalokagath&oacute;s</I>, <img src="images/greek/beaungod.gif" align=middle>, "beautiful and good."  Moral goodness concerns right and wrong actions; ethical goodness concerns what is good for human life, including right actions but also good shoes, good pizzas, etc.; and aesthetic goodness concerns what is simply good-in-itself, whether morally, in human life, or quite generally.  

<P><a name="distinction">The distinction</a> between morality and ideal, or <I>euergetic</I>, ethics is motivated by "<a href="dilemma.htm">The Generalized Structure of Ethical Dilemmas</a>," which demonstrates that the different categories of value are free and independent variables.  For teleological ethics and for moralistic (see below) deontological ethics, there would be no dilemmas -- the <I>goodness of the ends</I> or the <I>rightness of the means</I> would be all that counts.  The existence of a <I>sense of dilemma</I> is therefore evidence for the distinction between the two domains of value and so for the basic thesis that value is polynomic.

<P>Meanwhile, one might hope, as does Miranda in the passage from <I>The Tempest</I> quoted <a href="#">above</a>, that the morally good and the beautiful would necessarily be found together, as Miranda thinks they are in the person of the young Ferdinand of <a href="italia.htm#naples-2">Naples</a>.  But experience contradicts this hope with distressing regularity, even as Oscar Wilde meditated on their separation in <I>The Picture of Dorian Gray</I> [1890/1891], where the protagonist becomes more wicked precisely in proportion to the unnatural prolongation of his beauty.  This presupposes that otherwise the moral cost of his actions would have been <I>reflected</I> in his features, and that he was tempted to greater evils precisely because his uncompromised beauty gave him the <I>appearance</I> of goodness.  Miranda, unfortunately, would have fallen for it.

<P><center><img src="images/key.gif"></center>

<P>In the entire history of philosophy, I cannot say that I have found a single philosopher who asserts that the right and the good are equally real but can vary independently to produce dilemmas.  Dilemmas are still perplexing to all, right down to recent and trendy <a href="dilemma.htm#edmonds">treatments</a>.  Given the separate existence of "deontological and utilitarian ethics," one must be right and the other wrong.  We just haven't figured out how yet -- unless it just means that morality and value don't exist, except subjectively and individually (<a href="francia.htm#third">Hitler</a> had his own "values" and his own "morality," you see).

<P>What grounds, motivates, and dominates this failure is probably the <I>id&eacute;e fixe</I> that truth must be one, and value must be one.  There cannot be two, let alone a multiplicity of categories of value.  The exception may prove the rule, when we consider <a href="machiav.htm#berlin">Isaiah Berlin</a>, who famously posited a plurality of "goods."  However, Berlin did not separate the right from the good and did not restrict such a plurality only to goods.  So his plurality of goods also generates a plurality of contrary and paradoxical "moralities," which still leaves him with awkward dilemmas and improbable claims, including a strained and artificial interpretation of <a href="machiav.htm">Machiavelli</a>.  Berlin cannot simply say that a liberal political order is what is "right," since this would contradict his thesis; but he is then left with only morally weak and merely prudential or expedient reasons to recommend it, for which there is no moral obligation.

<P>The unity of value, of course, burns right through the page with Kant, for whom the only ultimate form of value is moral value (<I>das moralische Gesetz in mir</I>, "the moral law within me").  Any possible plurality of "goods" is a function, as we see <a href="#">above</a>, of "the <B>material</B> of the will, which is empirical, and therefore is incapable of the generality of a rule."  The empirical "material of the will," at the same time, is a function of our Fallen nature, which plagues us with sensibility and sensuality and curses us with a life among the moral imperfections (and annoying <a href="poly-1b.htm#music">music</a>) of phenomenal reality.  This tempts us away from pure morality.  So a practical plurality of goods in Kant is basically Satanic in function.  Without those temptations we would have "angelic wills" which, like <a href="confuciu.htm#fifty">Confucius</a> at 70, cannot deviate from what is right.

<P>This is almost the only remaining element that seems Christian in Kant's philosophy, as we can also gather from the "crooked timber" epigraph above, which makes it sound like our pure rational nature is only part of the corrupted and sensuous whole of our identity.  Otherwise Christ has disappeared as the means of redeeming us from our Fallen nature.  "Faith" in Kant depends on reason and morality, not on what would have been called <a href="numinos.htm#glaube">faith</a> in almost any actual religious tradition.  The Christian injunction to be perfect [<img src="images/greek/perfect.gif" align=middle>, Matthew 5:48] can only be satisfied by an eternity of striving -- Kant's argument for immortality.  This construction is not essentially changed even in the Friesian tradition, until <a href="otto.htm">Rudolf Otto</a>.  <a href="system.htm#diagram"><img src="images/onto-14.gif" align=right border=0></a>Faith and <a href="moral-1.htm#expiate">redemption</a> in the traditional sense does not exist in either Jakob Fries or Leonard Nelson.

<P>Yet Kant's philosophy allows us to have our cake and eat it too.  Value that appears divided and fractured among phenomena, in the world, may nevertheless exist as a unity, with truth, among things-in-themselves.  The diagram at right illustrates this with the model of the magnetic substates of physics, as discussed under the <a href="system.htm">system of metaphsics</a> here.

<P>Although the Friesians retain Kant's dualism, and the adoption of Schiller's distinction between morality and ideal ethics introduces the key element of the plurality of goods, they do not seem to have taken advantage of this either in ethics, to deal with the problem of dilemmas, or metaphysically, to allow a unity of value among things-in-themselves that we do not find in the world of experience.

<P>Indeed, the persistence of the <I>id&eacute;e fixe</I> about value, to the point where contrary ideas seem mostly to have never even occurred to philosophers, let alone to religions where the unity of the <a href="numinos.htm">holy</a> ties together all value, is the best evidence of the <I>intuitive</I> naturalness of such a feature of transcendent reality.  It has blinded philosophers who may otherwise have been looking <I>right at</I> the independent variation of value in moral dilemmas -- like Supreme Court Justices who look <I>right at</I> the Bill of Rights and ignore the assertion of the <a href="quiz.htm#text-2">Ninth Amendment</a> about rights "retained by the people."  Sophistry in lawyers, however, is nothing new or surprising.

<P>Of course, one may wonder how value can exist as a unity among things-in-themselves, while we see it in kaleidoscopic (<img src="images/greek/kaleidop.gif" align=middle>) variety (where kaleidoscopes, of course, rotate and change their pattern) among phenomena.  How does that work?  For this, we go back to Kant again, where there can be no consistent metaphysical theory of transcendent objects.  Instead, we get <a href="antinom.htm">Antinomies</a> and what Kant called "dialectical illusion," <I>der dialektische Schein</I>.

<P>Ordinarily, contradictions <a href="valley/rules.htm#indirect">imply falsehood</a>; but Kantian Antinomies occur even in <a href="cosmolog.htm">cosmology</a>, since the universe as a whole is not an object of a possible experience, i.e. a phenomenon.  This also reveals a key principle, since the character of the universe as a whole, like other candidate entities in the transcendent, is an <I>unconditioned</I> reality, while phenomena, as in <a href="buddhism.htm#basic">Buddhist metaphysics</a>, are mutually and unqualifiedly conditioned.  Kant's "Ideas" of unconditioned realities -- God, freedom, and immortality -- are poorly motivated by his attempt to use arguments from morality, and we know in particular from <a href="six.htm">Indian philosophy</a> that a personal God is not the only way to conceive ultimate reality as a Supreme Being -- a lesson lost when Western enthusiasts seem to think that (impersonal) Monistic Advaita Ved&acirc;nta, <img src="images/greek/advaita.gif" align=middle><img src="images/greek/school04.gif" align=middle>, is the only doctrine that occurs.<br clear=right>

<P><center><img src="images/key.gif"></center>

<P>Aesthetic valuation in general is pluralistic, latitudinarian (relatively relativistic -- see below), and not systematizable.  The aesthetic valuation of individual objects cannot be completely reduced to rules or definitions, for the concrete individual contains more than any rule can encompass and cannot be defined <I>qua</I> individual by finite predication.  <img src="images/tree04.gif" align=left>This is the aesthetic uniqueness and dignity of individual objects, endowing them with a specific non-relativistic value as goods-in-themselves, regardless of whether they appear beautiful or ugly.

<P><a name="text-0">The concept of Ideal ethical evaluation was proposed Schiller as a correction of Kant's <a href="poly-1b.htm#moralism">moralism</a>.  This was still called "ideal" ethics by Nelson, but that implies too narrow a range for it.  As everyone does good in their own estimation, and this is actually suitable in terms of what is (innocently) pleasing to themselves, so ideal (or hortative) valuation is relative to everyone's own purposes and desires.  Kant expresses this circumstance by saying, as quoted <a href="#">above</a>, "Welfare has no principle" (<I>Wohlfahrt aber hat kein Prinzip</I>), by which he means that the material good for individuals cannot be expressed as a general rule that would apply to all.  This poses a difficulty for teleological systems of morality (such as Utilitarianism), which must <I>prejudge</I> and predetermine goods for others.  Such goods cannot be prejudged.

<P>Kant should have concluded from this that there are non-moral goods in ethics, but he didn't.  And since these goods are not just "ideals," we should have a better name for this part of ethics.  It can be called "euergetic ethics," from <img src="images/greek/euergeto.gif" align=middle>, <I>euergete&ocirc;</I>, "to do good" -- roughly the equivalent of "beneficient" from Latin.  Euergetic ethics shares in aesthetic variety and pluralism, although in relation to the purposes of persons.  <img src="images/greek/euergete.gif" align=middle>, <I>Euerget&ecirc;s</I>, "Benefactor," was used as an epithet or title by many <a href="hist-1.htm">Hellensitic monarchs</a>.  The simple term "well-doing" in Greek would be <img src="images/greek/euergesi.gif" align=middle>, <I>euerges&iacute;a</I>, also "good service, a good deed, kindness, bounty, benefit."

<P><a name="text-0a">Although the principle of St. Thomas Aquinas is that the "The good is to be done" -- as we see in the statement by Charles Murray, for which he invokes Aristotle but not St. Thomas, in the <a href="#">epigraph</a> -- this collapses morality with ideals, creating <a href="poly-1b.htm">moralistic fallacies</a> [<a href="#note-0a">note</a>].  The principle is properly reduced from a moral imperative to an exhortation:  &nbsp;<a href="domain.htm#modes"><B>Hortatives</B></a> represent a form of aesthetic valuation in the sense that persons and their purposes form independent <I>aesthetic wholes</I> which are goods-in-themselves.  The attainment of the "good life" or "happiness" is a condition that is both pleasurable and aesthetically satisfying to persons.  How we can benevolently provide for the happiness for others when we cannot predetermine what they will find good or pleasurable makes for <I>a general problem for hortative value</I> -- as it is often a (maddening) problem when trying to buy birthday or Christmas presents, but has much more serious consequences in <a href="freestat.htm">paternalistic</a> politics based on <a href="moral-1.htm">moralistic altruism</a>.  The moral framework of <a href="capit-1.htm">capitalism</a> in the free market, as we will see, provides the answer to that problem.

<P>It is awkward to call hortative or aesthetic value "relativistic," since this would seem to be saying that moral <a href="relative.htm">relativism</a> is true, when actually moral relativism, just because of the existence of some moral absolutes, is false.  It is therefore better to call hortative and aesthetic value "latitudinarian," since it allows a "latitude" of goods and denies that there is a best life or a supreme good across a range of goods for human life.  That range is not unlimited as in strict relativism, and we might therefore say it is "relatively relativistic," which is a more honest relativism anyway.  The term "latitudinarian" appropriately hearkens back to the progress of Toleration in the 17th century, when the legal enforcement of religious belief and public morality came to be restrained and moderated, especially in the Netherlands and England.  The opposite of "latitudinarianism" is "rigorism," which is appropriate for morality as such, i.e. that there is no "latitude" or exceptions to the true moral rule.  Although we may be restrained in practice because of our sense of ignorance in Socratic absolutism and <a href="situatio.htm">Socratic situationism</a>, morality as such admits of no exceptions.

<H2><I>Hortative and Optative</I></H2>

<P>While hortative value, within ethics, exhibits features of aesthetic value, outside ethics, such as its pluralism, those features come into their own when free of the ethical context.  Various paradoxes of beauty and art then emerge.  Despite the truth of a epigraphs above -- <I>De gustibus non est disputandum</I>, "Tastes are not to be disputed," and <I>Chacun &agrave; son go&ucirc;t</I>, "Each to his taste" -- there is nevertheless no doubt and no mistaking it that taste is judged all the time, and things in bad taste, or persons possessing bad taste, are frequently identified in public and private discourse.  <img src="images/legs-b.gif" align=left>Reasons can even be given for such judgments, although without logically exhaustive criteria.  At the same time, taste obviously differs over time and different cultures; and so we see that aesthetic variety can challenge established forms of taste.  This may leave philosophers and theorists perplexed.

<P>Most perplexing are perhaps the metaphysical extremes by which the ground of beauty is described.  For Plato, beautiful things "participated" in the Form of Beauty and thus led the mind to contact with and contemplation of the transcendent.  With Kant, we find the opposite, that beauty is a subjective and "pleasant" state of mind, whose only connection to the transcendent is by way of the aesthetic subset of the <a href="sublime.htm">sublime</a>, which itself is only a reflex of the Moral Law.  There is no independent aesthetic reality -- no Form of the Beautiful -- or, as Plato would say, "beauty itself," <img src="images/greek/the-neut.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/kalon-g.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/auton.gif" align=middle> -- in Kant.  This is no more clearly evident than in Kant's trivialization of <a href="poly-1b.htm#music">music</a>.

<P>At the same time, Kant launched a characterization of aesthetic value as properly "disinterested," i.e. to be contemplated dispassionately.  <a href="erotic.htm"><img src="images/onto-13.gif" align=right border=0></a>Quite the opposite of Greek ideas about beauty, where the word "beauty" itself, <img src="images/greek/beauty0.gif" align=middle>, is not without even <a href="erotic.htm">erotic</a> overtones.  Plato himself, despite contributing "Platonic" as meaning a non-sexual love of another, nevertheless begins with <I>physical and erotic attraction</I> occasioned by beauty, which is then only <I>transformed</I>, following the path of higher contemplation, into something neither physical nor erotic -- we see this construction in both the <I>Symposium</I> and the <I>Phraedrus</I>.  We get the impression that the physical love is left behind, but this is actually not logically necessary for the point.

<P>Kant's idea of "disinterested" contemplation was an <I>accurate</I> reflex of the independence and objectivity of aesthetic value, where beautiful things are <I>goods in themselves</I>, with a dignity and autonomy that stands apart from human needs, desires, judgments, and purposes -- just as <a href="need.htm">flowers</a>, which evolved to attract bees (and other polinators) before humans even existed, nevertheless attract us also.  Indeed, since Kant denies that aesthetic value possesses such status, its "disinterested" contemplation is all that remains of its true character.  Improperly.  For, despite the independence of aesthetic value, our response to it can be interested and passionate indeed.  And beauty as a clue to the transcendent becomes more intimate than it ever was in Plato, since a reformist Kantian can actually replace the independent Platonic Forms with the Being of things in themselves, so that beauty as a connection to the transcendent is not just a clue to a separate world, but a window into a transcendent <I>presence</I> behind all appearances.  This is a revolutionary transformation of both Platonic and Kantian perspectives, making the transcendent, after a fashion, itself immanent, and allowing perspectives of both interested and disinterested contemplation.

<H3><a name="erotic"><I>Erotic Beauty</I></H3>

<P>The most striking and challenging feature of this may be the implied elevation in value of the <a href="erotic.htm">erotic</a>, even the erotic in <a href="porno.htm">pornography</a>.  Considering that few pornographers can be credited with good taste, and most pornography is obviously sordid, ugly, and disturbing, there is no intrinsic barrier to even naked sexual intercourse being portrayed, not just as erotic and beautiful, but even as sublime and numinous.  In the 1980's, there were moments when real efforts were made to elevate erotic films to these levels; and where some mainstream Hollywood movies, like <a href="lucy.htm"><I>Altered States</I></a>, achieved notable levels of erotic intensity.  <a href="sangoku.htm#dress"><img src="images/yakshini.gif" align=left border=0 width=200></a>This all passed both because of the political power of anti-pornography forces, on both the Right and the Left, which drove the genre out of respectable venues, and because pornographers themselves realized that they might as well not try.  Some of the more explicit nudity in <I>Altered States</I> was cut within days of its theatrical release, and has never been restored.  The potential for the genre, however, or for more explicit Hollywood products, 

<table align=right border cellpadding=5 bgcolor=white width=200><tr><td><img src="images/venus.jpg" align=right width=190></td></tr><tr><th>Seward Johnson, "Redon's Fantasy of Venus," based on the "Birth of Venus" by Odilon Redon; unusually shows the <I>rima pudendi</I></th></tr></table>

is starkly and undeniably revealed in an entirely independent source:  &nbsp;the erotic sculptures with which many temples in India are decorated.

<P>The degree to which women's <a href="sangoku.htm#dress">dress</a> and erotic sculpture in Classical India transgress Western standards of propriety, even the nudes of Greek and Roman sculpture, is extraordinary.  This involves several lessons.  First, the Indian aesthetic obviously goes way beyond what has been acceptable in both Modern and Classical Western civilization.  If even female royalty, in the age of <a href="sangoku.htm#mauryas">Ashoka</a>, wore costume that bared both their breasts and their genitals, then clearly beauty itself has broken through barriers that now are erected (even in India) against "indecent exposure," and not just for lower classes or prostitutes.

<P>Second, the erotic sculptures on Indian temples are obviously part of <I>sacred</I> art.  The numinous character of sex, however, is not unheard of in Greek and Roman religion.  Greek temples sometimes even featured representations of male genitals.  Female genitals can be seen elsewhere, as in traditional Japan, although sometimes in symbolic or stylized forms that are not always recognizable.<br clear=left>

<P><a name="text-13"><img src="images/voyager.gif" align=left width=250>On the other hand, Greek and Roman nude sculpture concedes nothing to the anatomy of female genitals, never showing the full <I>mons veneris</I> or a gap between the thighs, let alone the <I>rima pudendi</I>.  In space and structure there is no more provision for female sexual intercourse than there is in the conventional representations of mermaids; and European nudes have faithfully followed these conventions -- including the image of the nude couple at left, from the plaque placed on the Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 spacecraft, launched in 1972 and 1973, respectively.  The art for this was done by Linda Salzman Sagan, the wife of astronomer Carl Sagan.  There is obviously no attempt to portray female genitals or allow room for them [<a href="#note-13">note</a>].

<P>The third point, to recall the enumeration above, and most challenging, would be the idea that erotic beauty can be appreciated in even the Kantian "disinterested" sense, which reflects its aesthetic independence and autonomy.  It is not beyond conception that even Plato could allow that sacred representations of sexual copulation could suggest <img src="images/greek/the-neut.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/kalon-g.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/auton.gif" align=middle>, the beautiful itself.  Platonism would seem to involve a choice, whether the world is evil and fallen, condemning matter and carnal realities as repugnant, or whether the world reflects and instantiates, albeit transiently and imperfectly, the beauty and perfection of the Forms.  <a href="hist-1.htm#late">Neoplatonism</a> has more difficulty allowing the latter possibility.

<P>Indeed, it is the very power of such reality and its representation that makes it disturbing, both individually and collectively, in many cultures.  And the result can also be ambivalent, where erotic realities can be seen, not as good and beautiful, but as evil and ugly (as genitals can be called "uglies").  Where the erotic is ejected from the holy, it is not surpising that it gets picked up, because of its numinosity, by the <I>unholy</I>, as <I>demonic</I> rather than <I>divine</I> (with Satanists building their rites around sex, often with a naked woman in their altars).

<P>I venture to suggest that this is not right, for which the argument will continue with the consideration of pleasure, <a href="#pleasure">below</a>, and of anhedonia, <a href="poly-1b.htm#text-3">elsewhere</a>.  The erotic explicitness of Indian art, like honest government, may be a rare achievement, but it nevertheless represents a pinnacle, a <I>culmen</I>, an <img src="images/greek/acme.gif" align=middle>, of human civilization.  Where it is missing, we have something defective, ugly, and misused.<br clear=left>

<H2><I>Imperatives, Horatives, & Virtues -- <a href="key.htm#egypt"><img src="images/hiero/virtues.gif" align=middle border=0></a></I></H2>

<P><a href="moral-1.htm">Moral evaluation</a> is a case of a non-relative good-in-itself embedded in aesthetic and ideal value:  it is absolute and systematizable, reducible to the <I>system of respect for the autonomy of persons</I>.  Morality fundamentally concerns the acceptable <I>means</I> towards the ends of action.  Ideal ethics is the evaluation of <I>ends</I>, purposes, and consequences of action.  Morality itself is a subcase of such ends.  The force of evaluation of means and ends may become roughly balanced in that the <I>force of obligation</I> of morality, which is the only true obligation, stands over and against the <I>existence</I> of the consequences of action.  The existence of bad consequences may be regarded as of significance comparable to the force of moral obligation to do what is right, creating moral dilemmas.

<P><a name="text-1">Ideal ethics contains not just goods as ends but also goods as non-moral virtues of character.  These "hortative virtues" are often traditionally called <I>moral</I> virtues, but they really are not because they are not duties -- they are not <I>commanded</I> by morality.  Hortative virtues may be goods for the self or goods for others.  As goods for the self they are <img src="images/wrap-10.gif" align=left><I><B>virtues of prudence</B></I>.  As goods for others they are <I><B>virtues of manners</B></I> or <I><B>virtues of humanity</B></I>.  Virtues of prudence include all qualities, over and above moral virtues, that contribute to one's success in life with respect to one's own self-interest:  thriftiness, sobriety, frugality, providence, reliability, forethought, industriousness, punctuality, enterprise, etc. [<a href="#note-1">note</a>].  Virtues of manners generally involve some consideration for others, especially for the feelings of others, over and above what is morally required:  politeness, courtesy, kindness, etiquette, propriety, i.e. <I>good</I> manners.  Virtues of humanity involve more substantial consideration for others, bestowing supererogatory benefits through compassion, charity, liberality, etc.  Virtues of humanity are often thought of, not as hortative virtues, but as proper moral or legal obligations.  This issue will be considered elsewhere in relation to <a href="moral-1.htm#commission">non-contractual obligations of commission</a> and moralistic altruism [<a href="#note-2">note</a>].

<P><a name="taoism">Good manners were an enormously important part of <a href="confuci.htm">Confucian</a> ethics (the virtue of <img src="images/li3.gif" align=middle>, "propriety, etiquette, the rites") and previously of all proper upbringing.  Politeness, however, took a direct hit in the 60's, where authenticity became the ideal, no matter how rude or crude.  All sympathies then were in effect with the claim of the <a href="taote.htm"><I>Tao Te Ching</I></a>, the fundamental text of Taoism, that those who act on the basis of Confucian "propriety" are ready to resort to force if they cannot get their way.

<P><blockquote>A man of highest benevolence [<img src="images/ren2.gif" align=middle>] acts, but from no ulterior motive.  A man of the highest justice [<img src="images/yi2.gif" align=middle>] acts, but from ulterior motive.  A man most conversant in etiquette [<img src="images/li3.gif" align=middle>] acts, but when no one responds, rolls up his sleeves and resorts to persuasion by force.  Hence when the way [<img src="images/dao2.gif" align=middle>, the Tao] was lost, there was virtue [Te , <img src="images/te.gif" align=middle>]; when virtue was lost, there was benevolence [<img src="images/ren2.gif" align=middle>]; when benevolence was lost, there was justice [<img src="images/yi2.gif" align=middle>]; when justice was lost, there was etiquette [<img src="images/li3.gif" align=middle>].  Etiquette is the wearing thin of conscientiousness [<img src="images/zhong2.gif" align=middle>] and sincerity [<img src="images/xin.gif" align=middle>] and the beginning of disorder [<img src="images/luan.gif" align=middle>]. [Chapter 38:82-83, trans. after D.C. Lau]</blockquote>

<P>Note well that this is a <I>criticism</I>, not a statement, of Confucianism.  Now it turns out that rude and crude people cause a lot of unnecessary friction and conflict.  One response has been attempts to make lack of consideration for the <I>feelings</I> of others where racial or sexual relationships are concerned a moral or even a legal wrong ("<a href="moral-2.htm">hate speech</a>").  This actually confirms the fears that Confucians are ready to resort to force (the coercion of law).  Nevertheless, hortative virtues of good manners are real and important enough:  neither insignificant as many thought in the 60's nor the proper matter of moral or legal sanction.  Striking the balance may seem too subtle, but there is a real difference between what is merely, but actually, offensive and what is a moral wrong.  It helps to appreciate that they are in polynomically distinct domains of value.  <a name="text-2">The great traditional remedy</a> to the rude and the crude was that they do not belong in polite company:  we do not associate with them.

<H2><I>The Independence of Manners</I></H2>

<P><a name="text-3">The independence of manners from moral goodness is revealed in life and in literature by people who have good manners but are morally evil, and by those with very bad manners who are morally good.  An example of the former, now even the paradigmatic example, would be the cannibalistic murderer Hannibal Lecter of the 1988 novel, by Thomas Harris, and the 1991 movie, <I>Silence of the Lambs</I>.  As played by Anthony Hopkins, Lecter is polite himself and expects it of others (or he kills and eats them).  When he escapes from custody, the FBI agent who had been dealing with him, Clarice Starling, played by Jody Foster, is warned that he might come after her.  She knows he won't, because "he would consider that rude."  That line is actually not in the book, but it fits with what we might expect from Lecter [<a href="#note-3">note</a>].

<P><a name="text-12">A classic example of the opposite is Mr. Darcy in Jane Austen's immortal <I>Pride and Prejudice</I> [1813].  First encountering him at a dance, Elizabeth Bennett overhears him talking to his friend, Mr. Bingley.  Darcy refuses to dance because, "there is not another woman in the room [besides Bingley's sisters], whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with" --

this within hearing of Elizabeth, who has sat out two dances for lack of a partner.  When Bingley indicates Elizabeth herself, Darcy says:

<P><blockquote>'Which do you mean?' and turning round, he looked for a moment at Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said, 'She is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt <I>me</I>; and I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men....'</blockquote>

<P>Darcy thus brutally offends the very woman with whom he will later fall in love, and who rejects his own proposal for marriage, a proposal so undiplomatically offered that Elizabeth responds,

<P><blockquote>'I might as well enquire,' replied she, 'why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will, against your reason, and even against your character?'</blockquote>

<P>Darcy is shaken by this sudden revelation of how others could see him.  Elizabeth also had gotten the impression that Darcy behaved badly in more substantial ways.  This turned out to be wrong, and when Elizabeth came to discover that Darcy was, despite his manners, actually a very good man, she came to regret the haste and decidedness with which she had judged and rejected him.  Meanwhile, however, Darcy took Elizabeth's view of his manner seriously and wished to redeem himself.  Darcy learns to be more of a gentleman, and Elizabeth learns to wish that his attentions might be renewed, which, happily, they are.  It is then Elizabeth's father who is astonished at the revolution, and Elizabeth must inform him, "He is perfectly amiable.  You do not know what he really is..."

<P>It always makes for interesting characters in fiction, or sometimes even in life, when they are other than they seem, and manners are how people first appear to and affect others.  What this reveals here is the independent variability of polynomically independent categories of evaluation.<br clear=right>

<H2><I>Pleasure</I></H2>

<P>An important feature of the Polynomic Theory, not covered <a href="#">above</a>, concerns <B>pleasure</B>.  An early suggestion in Greek philosophy was that <B><I>pleasure is the good</I></B>.  As the Greek word for pleasure is <img src="images/greek/pleasure.gif" align=middle>, <I>h&ecirc;don&eacute;</I>, this theory has come to be called "Hedonism."  While today "hedonism" generally means the often careless, callous, and self-destructive personal pursuit of pleasure, the philosophical doctrine is simply the axiological postulate that pleasure is the good, or the only intrinsic good.  From the eponymous Greek Hedonists, the doctrine was continued by <a href="hist-1.htm#hellen">Epicurus</a> and survives in the significant modern school of <a href="bentham.htm">Utilitarianism</a>, with agreement that pleasure is the only intrinsic good.

<P>However, before this history had barely gotten off the ground, Plato had already succinctly refuted the theory in <a href="plato.htm"><I>The Republic</I></a>.  Having disposed of those who say that <I>knowledge</I> is the good, because, when pressed, they must admit that the knowledge that is good must be knowledge <I>of</I> the good, Plato has Socrates continue:

<P><blockquote>Well, are those who define the good as pleasure infected with any less confusion of thought than the others?  Or are not they in like manner compelled to admit that there are bad pleasures [<img src="images/greek/pleasur2.gif" align=middle>, <I>h&ecirc;don&agrave;s e&icirc;nai kak&aacute;s</I>, i.e. admit "pleasures to be bad"]?  (<I>Plato VI, Republic II</I>, Book VI, 505c, translated by Paul Shorey, Loeb Classical Library, Harvard U. Press, 1935, 1970, pp.88-89)</blockquote>

<P>If there are <I>bad pleasures</I>, <img src="images/greek/pleasur1.gif" align=middle>, this means that the categories of value, "good and bad" and "pleasure and pain," <I>vary independently</I>; and we should now be prepared to see this as evidence of the <I>polynomic independence</I> of pleasure.  As such, pleasure is properly part of the system presented above.  It does not occur there, however, because pleasure and pain are essentially subjective, where such cognitive or objective elements as they may have figure in the categories we have already seen -- right and wrong, good and evil, and the beautiful and the ugly.  Pleasure is not an additional element within the system, but it corresponds to the <I>whole</I> system (as Schopenhauer says that <a href="poly-1b.htm#music">music</a> represents the <I>whole will</I>), just as every form of value may be generally characterized as a "good."  This is one of the things that motivates a Hedonistic doctrine.  Why this should be so, we will see in turn.

<P>Pleasure as good may be <B>a</B> good, and an <B>intrinsic</B> good; but it will neither be the <B>only</B> good nor will it be free from varying independently and producing <B>dilemmas</B> with other goods, a characteristic of polynomic value.  This becomes evident with examples.  The pleasure of a heroin addiction has the consequences of the destruction of health, the disruption of personal and professional relationships, and the dangers of possible criminal activity.  In the same way, the pain of visiting the dentist has the consequence that tooth decay and other evils can be avoided -- recently we have learned that the Egyptian Queen <a href="notes/newking.htm#18">Hatshepsut</a> died of a dental abscess.

<P>Now, Epicurus would argue that each of these examples still allows for a Hedonistic explanation, since the heroin addiction produces great <I>pain</I> in the future, in all the areas considered, while the visit to the dentist enables a great deal of potential pain to be avoided thanks to proper dental hygene.  This is the Epicurean modification of Hedonism, that we may accept less pleasure or more pain in the present in order that pleasure can be maximized and pain minimized in the future.  Drunkenness may be enjoyable for the time being, but tomorrow we will endure much suffering from our indulgence; and continuing this as a way of life will produce a great deal of pain and unhappiness in the destruction of our health and the disruption of every other part of our lives.  The good Epicurean thus enjoys moderate pleasures and avoids anything more extreme that will produce pain in the future.

<P>Similarly, the modern Hedonist, apart from the Utilitarian who simply continues the principles of Epicureanism, may argue that even the satisfaction of having done something morally good is itself a kind of pleasure, which means that moral goodness is itself a kind of Hedonism.  Without the <I>pleasure</I> of moral satisfaction, all of ethics would simply be empty, and pleasure is consequently the only positive reason to ever do anything.

<P>While the strength of the argument of Epicurus is that health is expected to be pleasurable, and disease or injury certainly to be painful, the introduction of moral considerations upsets rather than confirms the line of reasoning.  For, just because someone takes moral satisfaction from some action, this does not mean that the action was in fact morally correct.  People may be confused, make mistakes, or positively enjoy doing evil.  We see a striking example of this in <a href="nietzsch.htm">Nietzsche</a>, which I will present with William Hogarth's print, the "First Stage of Cruelty" (1751), where we see children torturing animals for fun.  Those who idealize the innocence of childhood may not be aware that this behavior is not unusual, even today:

<P><blockquote>The delicacy -- even more, the <I>tartufferie</I> -- of domestic animals like ourselves shrinks from imagining clearly to what extent <B>cruelty</B> [<I>Gausamkeit</I>] constituted the collective delight of older mankind, how much it was an ingredient of all their joys, or how na&iuml;vely they manifested their cruelty,

<P>The persons who discover that they enjoy watching cruelty or suffering, and not just in fiction, should very properly be alarmed, as those around them are likely to be.  "To behold suffering gives pleasure, but to cause another to suffer affords an even greater pleasure" -- <I>Leiden-sehn thut wohl, Leiden-machen noch wohler</I>.  Such a person has developed a <B>perverse affect</B>.  If they then act on that enjoyment by <I>causing suffering</I> -- <I>Leiden-machen</I> -- they have become morally <B>vicious</B> -- the fear of which probably being the reason for the alarm of people around them -- and they have been improperly motivated by their feelings into wrongful action.  Of course, that was precisely Nietzsche's point, that "wrongful action" and "vice" are themselves meaningless characterizations, and not because Nietzsche was any kind of Hedonist:  &nbsp;"Man does not strive for pleasure, only the Englishman does."  Not pleasure, or even happiness, but power, was the Nietzschean goal, unlimited by any moral inhibitions over the rights or feelings of others, especially the miserable and pathetic weak ones, whose condition cries out for selfish use and exploitation by the strong.  Nietzsche is not credited with a doctrine that <I>power is the only intrinsic good</I>, but he could be, especially when modern Nihilists (<a href="hermenut.htm">deconstructionists</a>, <a href="rand.htm#modern">post-modernists</a>, etc.) obviously embrace something of the sort.

<P>Pleasure or satisfaction in the wrong and the evil simply reveals the independence of the objective good from our experience of pleasure and pain.  Since there are <I>bad pleasures</I>, <img src="images/greek/pleasur3.gif" align=middle>, right and wrong, good and bad, and the beautiful and the ugly must be judged on their own merits and in their own terms.  Even the beautiful, much of whose value would appear to consist in the pleasure that it affords, nevertheless enjoys the characteristic that, the greater its value, the more that value is <I>independent</I> of the transient beings who may encounter it.  Beauty is a supreme <I>good-in-itself</I>; and its intrinsic value <I>increases</I> as its appreciation becomes more refined.  Thus, while the <B>vandal</B> derives enjoyment from the thrill of destruction, the severity of their actions as crime is different in kind when they move from damage to fungible chattels to objects that are irreplaceably valuable in their own right.  The more perverse vandals, of course, derive particular pleasure from destroying the latter.<img src="images/tree03.gif" align=left>

<P>While the polynomic independence of pleasure can produce conflicts that look like <I>dilemmas</I>, they are rarely real <I>moral</I> dilemmas because personal pleasure rarely has anything like the moral force needed to outweigh moral duty.  Thus, if I consider doing wrong for the sake of my own pleasure, this is not an objectively good end but precisely the kind of egoistic self-interest that generally motivates wrongful action in the first place.  It is not like weighing the survival of all against some in a <a href="valley/dilemmas.htm#1">life-boat</a> dilemma.  A more innocent conflict may occur, not between pleasure and duty, but between pleasure and other kinds of hortative goods.  Thus, I may decide to buy a more expensive car because it will give me greater pleasure than a cheaper economy car.  This may involve a genuine moral conflict if, for instance, I have taken on the obligations of parenthood to spend the money on clothes or food for my children, or it may merely reflect my preference, that I prefer the pleasure of motoring over that of a more expensive house, a better sound system, high maintenance girl friends, or gambling in Las Vegas.  Or I may contribute this disposable income to charity, which has a more laudable overtone, if I am assured that the charities I patronize are actually doing some good.

<P>Two features, at least, distinguish pleasure and pain from all other forms of value:  &nbsp;(1) they are <B>intuitive</B>, and (2) they are <B>caused</B>.  Thus, as pleasure or pain arise, they are identified and distinguished by careful attention to the <I>sensation</I> or the <I>feeling</I> -- the response in us -- which, of course, may be so forceful that the sensations intrude themselves on our attention, regardless of our intentions or predisposition.  We do not experience pleasure or pain in external objects, detached from our own existence, whether corporeal or, as representations or abstract objects, mental.  The character of the external objects, however, is <I>responsible</I> for the reaction that we experience.  Of course, the kind of reaction we have, does not depend <I>entirely</I> on the object, but the mechanism of our response, physical or mental, contributes to the character of what we experience.  So, people do not experience pleasure or pain in the same ways from the same objects.  The music of Barbra Streisand that strikes many people as enjoyable may be insufferable, or positively painful, to others -- there has been an episode of <I>South Park</I> devoted to this.  The Japanese enjoy squid on pizza, even though foreigners may find the consistency of the seafood no different from, and no tastier than, rubber.

<P>Pleasure varies across a spectrum from the most concrete and physically localized to the most abstract and mental.  At the one end are thus pleasures or pains with specific locations in the body, as we experience with food and sex, or with the pain of bodily injury or disease.  These are so paradigmatic that we imagine the common practical hedonist as pursuing his values by eating and copulating, preferable in the midst of something like a Roman orgy, whose <a href="decdenc1.htm"><img src="images/decadenc.jpg" align=right border=0>decadent</a> attraction is precisely the combination of uninhibited eating, drinking, nudity, and sex.  A wild party is one thing, but it isn't a proper orgy without promiscuous sex and nudity.  The rigors and follies of such a life-style were explored by <B>Hogarth</B> (16971764) in his series on "A Rake's Progress" (1735).

<P>With the physical localization of pain, a noteworthy feature is the often involuntary response of the body.  If you are burned or cut, there is likely to be a "knee-jerk," instinctive recoil of the affected body part or limb away from the source of the injury.  You don't need to think about it.  This is comparable to instinctive reactions like the mouth watering or sexual arousal, although those responses require <I>recognition</I> of particular kinds of objects for the reaction to occur (unless the former results from the smell of food or its directly being introduced into the mouth, or the latter from direct stimulation of the genitals).  Burning oneself on something that has not even been recognized as being hot, however, sets off an often dramatic recoil that doesn't need any conscious intention or understanding.

<P><a name="text-4">As pleasure may be derived from detached and even remote external objects, the cognitive element, as in the emotions, increases.  The first stage with this concerns senses whose effect is more intimate and direct on the body.  The pleasant scent, or the disgust of an unpleasant smell, act almost as immediately on the body as the sensations of taste or responses to actual touch.  With sounds, we get into a larger domain.  Loud noises, like bright lights, can themselves be painful as much as more corporeal assaults on the body.  <I>Pleasant</I> sounds begin to sound <I>musical</I>, and then <I>become</I> <a href="poly-1b.htm#music"><img src="images/beethove.jpg" align=left border=0>music</a>.  This is one of the most mysterious phenomena of human experience.  Music can produce pleasure or pain to the extent that it is able to evoke pleasant or painful <a href="emotion.htm">emotions</a>.  Even relatively painful emotions may be <I>enjoyed</I> in the sense that they can be <I>cathartic</I>.  Yet the sounds of music as such convey no cognitive content whatsoever, while the emotions are heavy with cognitive associations.  Indeed, what particular music means to one will depend on one's prior emotional state and history, not an insignificant part of which will have been the experiential context of particular pieces of music.  Yet an entirely new piece of music, just written, can set off intense reactions, evoking associations whose forms may lie deep in the unconscious [<a href="#note-4">note</a>].

<P>Sight is the most detached and objective of the senses and involves the largest cognitive element in the recognition of its objects.  The beautiful landscape, in person or in various representations, may evoke a very quiet kind of pleasure, but, of course, this would serve as a recommendation rather than a criticism to a Hedonist like Epicurus.  As the beautiful shades over into the <a href="sublime.htm">sublime</a>, awe and wonder, if not a cathartic or <a href="numinos.htm">numinous</a> kind of fear, begin to infuse the pleasant experience.  In performing arts, to the visual spectacle of the theater there is added the display of action, emotion, language, and story, perhaps with the addition of music.  <img src="images/halfdome.jpg" align=right>Modern movies are able to increase the vividness of all this, although perhaps with more emphasis on image and music than on language.  On the other hand, pure literature takes the word alone and uses it to feed the imagination, from which comes a whole internal theater of images, sounds, and perhaps even music -- not to mention sensual reactions in taste, scent, and sexual arousal -- although all of these will depend idiosyncratically on the experience, memory, and imaginative capacity of the reader.

<P>And what is the pleasure of seeing the "good guys" win or the lovers at long last united in any story?  This involves an element of <I>moral</I> and <I>euergetic</I> satisfaction, which reaches a moral culmination in the satisfaction of seeing justice done, or the good accomplished, whether in fiction or in reality.  The "moral" of a story, by which the whole purpose of a fictional work is manifest, is an aesthetic, moral, and cognitive unity.  The <I>enjoyment</I> of the story hinges on how well that is done, both in the culmination in and in the manner the story builds towards it.

<P>The pleasure, satisfaction, or enjoyment that we experience in life and in art provide a clue about the <I>metaphysical</I> status of pleasure.  <B>Pleasure is to subjective and internal existence as the good itself is to objective and external existence.</B>  Experiencing, observing, or contemplating the realization of the good properly corresponds to an internal state of pleasure.  Polynomic independence, of course, means, as Plato said, that there are bad pleasures, <img src="images/greek/pleasur3.gif" align=middle>; but just as the good person who is forced, by evil circumstances, <a href="dilemma.htm">to do wrong</a> in order to effect the good, the good person, discovering that he derives pleasure from evils, endeavors by reflection and discipline to correct his affections.

<P>The theory of the "<a href="good.htm">Lecture on the Good</a>" is that the good is existence, from whose simple identity we have been alienated by the structure of consciousness.  Pleasure in turn is thus our internal experience of the good, instantiated in our own existence, even as the cognitive and objective good is a quality that can subsist in objects detached, remote, and unrelated to us.  As with all of the categories of value, we would like to see all goods line up and coincide, with the beautiful, the right, and pleasure all together without dilemma, conflict, or contradiction.  Life, of course, is characteristically not that simple, and much of our activity consists in trying to keep the positive together without compromise by the negative.

<P>A historic challenge to this endeavor comes from those whose sense is that pleasure itself is wrongful or vicious.  This is the moral fallacy of <B>anhedonia</B>, which is examined in detail <a href="poly-1b.htm#text-3">elsewhere</a>.  Anhedonia is often the motivation for <B>anaesthesia</B>, which denies independent value to beauty, along with condemning its enjoyment.  As I understand the ontology of pleasure here, anhedonia functions essentially as <B><I>the condemnation and denial of the value of our own existence</I></B>.  It is not surprising then to discover anhedonia in religions that deny the value of the world and look to a proper mode of human existence only in an afterlife.  <a href="bliss.htm"><img src="images/teresa.jpg" align=right border=0></a>The variations in this are instructive.  Thus, while anhedonic moral condemnations of pleasure may be found in both Christianity and Islam, this does not prevent Islamic representations of the afterlife from picturing it in sensuous and even carnal terms, where marriages will continue and there will even be the supernatural equivalent of concubines, the "houris," <img src="images/greek/houris.gif" align=middle>, <I>h.&ucirc;r&icirc;y&acirc;t</I> (singular <img src="images/greek/houri.gif" align=middle>, <I>h.&ucirc;r&icirc;yah</I>).  Christianity, on the other hand, has a Biblical denial that there will be marriage in heaven (Matthew 22:30) and tends to interpret this to mean that carnal pleasures will not exist, replaced by a <a href="bliss.htm">Beatific Vision</a> more like the mystical transport of earthy Saints -- although <B>Bernini's</B> rendering of "The Ecstasy of Saint Teresa" (of Avila) makes this state look positively orgasmic -- something to keep in mind when encountering those who condemn the Islamic Paradise for its apparent <I>sensuality</I> (!).  On the other hand, <a href="buddhism.htm">Buddhism</a>, which in origin was no less denying of the value of earthly existence, rarely displays moral condemnation or hostility towards the pleasures of ordinary life.  One might get the sense that Buddhism, which features belief in reincarnation, expects that people will simply <I>tire</I> of the endless repetitions of Samsara, where the pleasures of life, however attractive and even morally innocent, unavoidably are coupled with pain, evils, and suffering.

<P>In all this pleasure is owed a certain pride of place in any theory of value.  The judgment of Epicurus in one sense may be well taken.  However, there is considerably more to it than the simple principles of the Hedonists, Epicureans, or Utilitarians.  Pleasure <I>is</I> indeed the Good in a certain metaphysical sense, but it is <I>not</I> the Good with a cognitive identity that is a reliable guide in moral or even aesthetic judgment.  The Polynomic Theory of Value allows us to make sense of this, as all forms of value, including pleasure, can vary independently of each other.  If we remember that there are bad pleasures, <img src="images/greek/pleasur3.gif" align=middle>, we will have a care that we exercise our moral, euergetive, and prudential judgment about our pleasures.  We don't want our "guilty" pleasures to constitute genuine moral or legal guilt, or to degrade our health.  Otherwise, we should remember Aristotle:

<P><blockquote>Men erring on the side of deficiency as regards pleasures [<img src="images/greek/pleasur4.gif" align=middle>, <I>h&ecirc;don&aacute;s</I>], and taking less than a proper amount of enjoyment [<img src="images/greek/enjoying.gif" align=middle>, <I>kha&iacute;rontes</I>, "enjoying"] in them, scarcely occur; for such insensibility [<img src="images/greek/anaesthe.gif" align=middle>, <I><B>anaisth&ecirc;s&iacute;a</B></I>] is not human [<img src="images/greek/not3.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/human.gif" align=middle>, <I>ouk anthr&ocirc;pik&eacute;</I>]. (<I>Nicomachean Ethics</I>, Book III, xi, 7, Loeb Classical Library, Harvard U. Press, 1926-1982, pp.180-183)</blockquote>

<P>Since we know from much of subsequent history, not only that such men do exist, but that their inhumane "insensibility" (anaesthesia) has been built into various religions and political ideologies, we must also be conscious that pleasures <I>are goods</I> and that it is natural, indeed salutary, to enjoy them.  We should want our company to be agreeable if we join Epicurus, or Voltaire, in his Garden.<br clear=right>

<P>Talleyrand famously said, "Those who did not live in the eighteenth century before the [French] <a href="francia.htm#revolution">Revolution</a> do not know the sweetness of living," <I>Celui qui n'a pas v&eacute;cu au dix-huiti&egrave;me si&egrave;cle avant la R&eacute;volution ne conna&icirc;t pas la douceur de vivre</I>.

<P>However, about a century later, we get something else.  What comes to be called <I>La Belle &Eacute;poque</I> in France, from the end of the Franco-Prussian War (1871) to the beginning of World War I (1914), was something both very much like and very much different from the life Talleyrand had known.  It was thus also an era in which people seemed to experience <I>la douceur de vivre</I>, but now this was a broad based, bourgeois phenomenon.  It literally spilled out into the streets, as the French enjoyed their sidewalk caf&eacute;s, which were to be found everywhere.  <a href="francia.htm#2rep">Napoleon III</a> had rebuilt Paris and, once the Germans were gone, and the damage had been repaired, everyone could enjoy it.

<P>The interest on this page, with issues relevant to the <a href="#">Polynomic Theory of Value</a> and to <a href="#pleasure">pleasure</a>, is the degree to which <I>La Belle &Eacute;poque</I> embodied and symbolized the prosperity and the innocent pleasures of the "good life" and of the goods of horative value.

This was characteristic of the times at the end of the 19th Century and in the decade before World War I.  The nature of the era, however, is also a matter of dispute.

<P>In the United States, although the economy grew into the largest in the world and desperate people poured off the boats from Europe, especially from Russia and Italy at the time, there were nevertheless difficulties, with <a href="money.htm">deflation</a> from the Civil War until 1897, serious labor trouble, and depressions in the 1870's (1873-79), 1880's (1882-85), and 1890's (1893-94, 1895-97).  Because of deflation, it looked like people's pay was shrinking, even when real wages were rising, a difference not likely to be evident to most observers at the time.  The free minting of silver, although contrary to the spirit of the Gold Standard that had been adopted in 1873, mitigated deflation for a while; but then the repeal of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act in 1893 and the end of Free Silver minting set off the worst economic panic and contraction of the times, with features like every railroad in the country, except one (the Great Northern) going bankrupt.  Consequently, although there is a memory of the "Gay Nineties," more characteristic was the epithet of the "Gilded Age," applied by Mark Twain, when the very rich fourished at the expense of the workers.  The reality was different, but confused economics and genuine troubles left a bad impression.  Meanwhile, the situation in Britain tends to be filtered through a Dickensian lens, even though Dickens was writing about earlier times and Britain actually had fewer of the travails of the United States.  But British growth was actually less than that of the Americans, and <a href="capit-1.htm#ford">Henry Ford</a> had better ideas how to "spread the wealth" than did Mr. Rolls and Mr. Royce.  Nevertheless, the Britain of the <a href="foundatn.htm#holmes">Sherlock Holmes</a> stories is that of a comfortable, successful, and prosperous society.  While the stories contain significant moral reflection, there is little politics apart from the occasional patriotic sentiment.

In France, despite anarchists and other troubles, the times are filtered through a different kind of lens.  French society of <I>La Belle &Eacute;poque</I> is something now visible in the artwork of the Impressionist painters, whose images remain one of the most popular forms of modern art.  Like the Neo-Rafaelites in Britain, the Impressionists shift to bright, vivid, luminous color.  But while the Neo-Rafaelites liked mythological or moralizing Victorian didactic paintings, the Impressionists went for the enjoyments of contemporary daily life.

<P>An excellent example is Renoir's "Dance at Bougival," <I>Bal &agrave; Bougival</I> (1883), at right.  This was painted with two other dance pictures, "Dance in the City" and "Dance in the Country."  It took Renoir a bit longer to complete "Bougival," and it has a slightly different character, and is larger, than the others.

<P>"Bougival" shows two of Renoir's own friends, Suzanne Valadon and Paul Auguste Llhote; it is named after a specific location; and it is superior in execution.  It gives the best sense of motion of the three paintings, where in "Dance in the City," with the couple very formally dressed, it is not clear that they are moving at all, while in "Dance in the Country," it looks more like the girl has stumbled into her partner, perhaps the worse for drink.  <img src="images/bougiva2.jpg" align=left>In "Bougival," however, there is a sweep, confidence, and elegance to the motion.  The expression of Suzanne Valadon is also different.  Like St. Teresa <a href="#pleasure">above</a>, her eyes are slightly closed and she is not obviously looking at anything.  But with her slight smile, her expression is not of mystic ecstasy but of quiet enjoyment.  She feels the pleasure of the dance and the attention of her partner.  There is nothing orgasmic about this, just the beauty and sensation of the moment.  We get a better look at the women than at the men in all the dance paintings, but Suzanne Valadon has most the intriguing, relaxed, and even dreamlike expression.<br clear=right>

<P>Another difference between "Bougival" and the other dance paintings is the background.  Right behind Suzanne Valadon is a table with another couple, and other people visible beyond them.  On the table are what seem to be glasses of beer.  This may seem more German than French.  We likely would imagine German pastimes of the era as involving beer gardens, an institution imported to the United States by German immigrants, including beer makers.

This reaches into my own life, since I much enjoyed Scholz's Beer Garden (i.e. the <a href="http://www.scholzgarten.com/">Scholz Garten</a>) in <a href="ross/ross-2.htm#texas">Austin</a>, Texas, including the night of my graduation in 1985.  If the Germans had just stayed in their beer gardens in 1914, subsequent history would have been a lot happier.

<P>Viewing the "Dance at Bougival" at the Philadelphia Museum of Art where it was on loan for an exhibition (its permanent home is in Boston), a woman pointed out to me that the leaves in the background of the painting are not drawn sharply.  They look as they might if we were twirling around ourselves and saw them quickly pass by.  While the other background figures do not share in that effect, this adds to the sense of motion we might get from the dancers, especially as Suzanne Valadon's dress flares out.  The dancers have been twirling themselves.

<P>The "Dance at Bougival" and the whole <I>La Belle &Eacute;poque</I> are a poke in the eye to all <a href="poly-1b.htm#text-3">anaesthesia and anhedonia</a>, especially the political versions that may accompany moral indignation about the era, and thus might equally well have been treated under those topics.  <a href="francia.htm#philos"><img src="history/straus2.jpg" align=left width=200 border=0></a>For their positive meaning, however, they belong here with the hortative goodness of polynomic value and pleasure.  And, unlike the cases of pleasure considered above, these exemplify very ordinary occasions of what we might think of as the "good life."  A leisurely Sunday, or a night out, with our friends and lovers, drinking, dancing, and talking, or listening to music, add up to a lot of the pleasure and enjoyment that we can imagine in daily life.  This is all what <I>moral principles make possible</I> as the <I>sine qua non</I> of the positive content of life.  Once we are safe in our persons and property, and prosperous in our vocation, then we can have some fun.  We must reflect, in turn, how little fun there is in war or in the grim anhedonia of religion and political activitism at their extremities.

<H2><I>The Dreyfus Affair</I></H2>

<P>However, the pleasures of <I>La Belle &Eacute;poque</I> were seriously compromised by one particular controversy.  This was the <B>Dreyfus affair</B> (<I>l'affaire Dreyfus</I>) from 1894 to 1906.  A Jewish French Army officier, <img src="images/legs-g.gif" align=left>Captain Alfred Dreyfus, of <a href="germany.htm#alsace">Alsatian</a> origin ("Dreyfus" was an inhabitant of the city of <a href="popes.htm#electors">Trier</a>), was convicted of spying for Germany.  He was sent to the infamous Devil's Island in French Guiana, whose charms are displayed in the Steve McQueen movie <I>Papillon</I> [1973].

<P>The whole prosecution seems to have been motivated by anti-Semitism.  And although the actual spy was soon identified, the Army swifted acquitted <I>him</I> and added extra charges against Dreyfus, based on forged documents.  This was all exposed in the epic <I>J'accuse</I> of &Eacute;mile Zola, published in January 1898.  Zola has added an expression even to modern English, used by <a href="nullif.htm">Rumpole of the Bailey</a>.

<P>Dreyfus was retried in 1899 but convicted again.  He was then pardoned by the new <a href="francia.htm#3rep">President of France</a>, &Eacute;mile Loubet.  By 1906 Dreyfus was exonerated and reinstated in the Army, serving during World War I.

<P>The fury of the conflict, however, is now hard to comprehend.  Old friends stopped speaking to each other.  Edgar Degas ceased speaking to a life-long friend and collaborator, Ludovic Hal&eacute;vy, just because one of Hal&eacute;vy's guests at a party said something favorable about Dreyfus.  Anti-Semites (Degas?!) acted like Dreyfus <I>had to be guilty</I>; and the Army was willing to use any dishonest means to convict him and keep him convicted.  When some of them later became Nazi collaborators in World War II, it became more obvious that they had hated Jews more than they had ever hated Germany, or cared about German spying.

<P>Thus, the experience of Alfred Dreyfus was all a grim portent for the appalling and ignominious end that would come to the Third Republic in 1940.  Mercifully, Dreyfus himself had died in 1935, apparently still somewhat puzzled by the whole business.

<P>This was a grim portent of the course of anti-Semitism in the 20th century.  The Dreyfus Affair and the Progroms (<img src="images/greek/pogrom.gif" align=middle>, "devastation," "massacre" -- unrelated to "program") in Russia seem to have led, with a sort of insane inevitability, to the Nazi Holocaust, like the ambition now openly voiced by the government of "Islamic" <a href="iran.htm#islamic">Iran</a>, as part of <a href="afghan.htm#fascism">Islamic Fascism</a>, to exterminate Israel and the Jews.  The "Progressive" <a href="rand.htm#modern">Left</a> in the West, exposing its totalitarian roots, is all on board.<br clear=left>

<P>It also seems like a name of ill omen for Ritchie Valens (Richard Steven Valenzuela, 1941-1959), who died in a plane crash with Buddy Holly (Charles Hardin Holley, 1936-1959) on the fateful "day the music died."  The birth name of Valens, Valenzuela, is itself a diminutive of "Valencia," a surname based on the name of the city of <a href="islam.htm#taifa-9">Valencia</a>, whose Latin name was itself <I>Valentia</I>, i.e. a noun from <I>valens, valentis</I>.  "Valenzuela" in turn was also a place name, i.e. "places in the provinces of Ciudad Real and C&oacute;rboda" [<I>The Oxford Dictionary of Surnames</I>, 1988, pp.550-551].  We may not know whether Richie Valens was simply abbreviating his given name or realized he was going back to its Latin root.  Presumably he did not know of the ill omened association with the Roman Emperor.  But a nice trivia question now would be the connection between the death of Buddy Holly and the Battle of Adrianople.

<P>The Friesian theory of "ideal ethics" is not to be confused with "ideal theory" as it may now be found in academic philosophy.  Among some other things, "ideal theory" is an artifact of <I>A Theory of Justice</I> by <a href="nature.htm">John Rawls</a>, where Rawls chose to consider an "ideal" case where everyone in society would obey the rules of justice that he was formulating.  Since it is obvious that not everyone would obey, and do not obey, the rules of justice, whether formulated by John Rawls or not, he realized that a "nonideal" theory would need to adjust things to reality.

<P>Thus, in the first place, such "ideal theory" has nothing to do with ideal ethics in the Friesian sense.  Ethical ideals, like all of hortative value, are not moral commands (i.e. imperatives) and so actually do not need to be obeyed by moral agents.  Indeed, ideal ethics, because of its aesthetic variety and plurality, contains a range of possible acitivities that <I>cannot</I> be simultaneously obeyed, as a practical matter, by any agent.  It encompasses all possible worthy ends of human acitivity and so is more than any individual can do.  The "ideal" is therefore not a case of everyone obeying justice, but of the possible goals and ideals of human action.

<P>In the second place, "ideal" is not even the best term for the Friesian conception.  Schiller's response to Kant was to posit ideal goals <I>other</I> that the moral "kingdom of ends" that was envisioned by <a href="moral-1.htm#note-1">Kant</a>.  After all, Kant's ideal was simply moral perfection, which he did not think we could achieve in this lifetime (and so required immortality as a "Postulate of Practical Reason").  Schiller rightly objected that there were other ideals, as of art, that were not commanded by morality.

<P>But Schiller overlooked the more humble forms of non-moral value in ethics.  Good shoes or a good dinner, which in their own ways may be forms of art, nevertheless may not seem to rise quite to the level of "ideals," although anyone is free to imagine their ideal restaurant serving their ideal meal.  But this is beyond the stuff of daily life; and the merely good, but not "ideal," shoes or dinners already falsify the exclusiveness of moral value in Kantian ethics.  The narrowness, in its own way, of Schiller's theory is reflected, I think, in the term <a href="domain.htm#modes">optative</a> used for the ideals.  An "optative" is a wish.  But a "wish" implies that, in a sense, we are <I>spectators</I> to things beyond our control, just hoping for a positive outcome, while in ethics we are <I>agents</I> who can actually <I>effect</I> the outcome by our actions.  I have thus thought that "hortative" was the more appropriate term, as expressing an exhortation to action.  This is neither a command nor merely a wish.

<P>With Rawls, I would wonder at the point of his "ideal" conception.  The characteristic of value in general is that it need not obtain in reality.  And the corresponding characteristic of moral and ethical value is that free agents will chose whether to observe it or not.  It is therefore not just counterfactual and unrealistic to imagine a society where everyone obeys justice, but it is absurd.  There is no point in an "ideal theory" which contradicts the realities of freedom and of human nature.  And this is especially egregious with a "social contract" theory like that of Rawls, which, from the day of the publication of his book, was criticized as providing no explanation of why anyone would be obliged to obey the rules of justice formulated by him in the first place.  I do not think it is a good sign that academic philosophers should still be preoccupied with Rawls, but it must mean that there is a lack of more sensible theories for everyone to talk about.

<P>This touches a sore point in contemporary politics and law.  The politicians and judges who take oaths to "preserve, protect, and defend" the Constitution of the United States, nevertheless expect citizens to <I>obey</I> their tendentious and sophistical <I>intepretations</I> of the Constitution, which coincidentally give them far more power than the mere citizens might think from reading the document.  And if the citizen refuses to obey, or objects to the interpretations, he might be asked, as I was once asked by a judge, "Have you been to law school?"  In other words, shut up and obey your betters.  They know more than you; and your freedom and your fortune, such as is left of them, are properly disposed of by their hands.  The paradox of "social contract" theories is that they do not consider the <a href="rent.htm">rent-seeking</a> and despotic proclivities of those ostenstively charged with enforcing them.

<P>At the same time, here may be a use for Rawls' "ideal theory" as a <I>reductio ad absurdum</I> thought experiment.  If the hypothesis is that everyone obeys Rawls' rules of justice, or those of any other theory, what is this going to look like and what is it going to mean?  If it obviously generates absurdities, then it is a kind of Kantian universalization test that falsifies the theory.  But the absurdities may be less obvious.  After all, the idea of a communist "new man" was popular in the 20th century, and some reporters visiting <a href="sangoku.htm#communist">China</a> with President <a href="presiden.htm#37">Nixon</a> thought that maybe it had actually happened there -- the development of people whose every action was disinterested and who only worked for the good of others and of all.  Indeed, the ambition of totalitarian projects is always to change human nature, not believing that such a thing even exists in a fixed form.

<P>Rawls had no such ambition, and so perhaps he has less excuse for a theory detached from the realities of moral and economic motivation.  For, as it happens, both communism and Rawls' "original position" suffer from one of the same drawbacks, that goods are detached from those who produce them.  Under both communism and Rawlsian "justice," the fruit of one's own labor can be snatched away by the state, simply on the principle that someone else needs it more.  While there may be many willing, out of the goodness of their hearts, to help the needy, it also starts becoming obvious that the minions of the state, who are neither productive nor indigent, always do very well off the transaction also, much more so than the needy ever do.  Then they start lecturing the productive about their <a href="greed.htm">selfishness</a>.  It is soon obvious that their actions are more self-serving that those of almost anyone in productive business.

<P>The "ideal" of either the workers' paradise or the welfare state thus crumbles into a sordid racket of looting the public in order the enrich the well connected -- people who also have the arrogance to exhibit considerable self-righteousness about their status and motives.  They can't just rob us and leave us alone.  They have to tell us how much good they are doing.  And some people, hat in hand, tugging their forelock, believe them and vote for them.

<P>Charles Murray, <I>The Curmudgeon's Guide to Getting Ahead, Dos and Don'ts of Right Behavior, Tough Thinking, Clear Writing, and Living a Good Life</I> [Crown Business, 2014, p.105; color added]</blockquote>

<p><center><img src="images/bar.gif"></center>

<P>Noteworthy in Murray's treatment of these matters is a bit of misinformation.  Thus, Murray says:

<P><blockquote>The development of a certain kind of mature judgment is hard to rush.  The Greeks called it <I>phronesis</I>, usually translated as <I>practical wisdom</I> (the concept will reappear in tip #27).  An essential part of <I>phronesis</I> is not just the acquisition of chunks of knowledge, but life experience. [<I>The Curmudgeon's Guide to Getting Ahead, Dos and Don'ts of Right Behavior, Tough Thinking, Clear Writing, and Living a Good Life</I>, Crown Business, 2014, pp.89-90, "tip" #21]</blockquote>

<P>Actually, by the "Greeks" Murray means Aristotle, as he otherwise acknowledges.  And while <img src="images/greek/prude.gif" align=middle>, <I>phronesis</I>, can be and is often translated "practical wisdom," the more natural translation is from the Latinate equivalent, "prudence" (<I>prudentia</I>), which we will see shortly.

<P>In tip #27 we get some of the misinformation.  First is this:

<P><blockquote>The four cardinal virtues were originated by the Greeks.  They subsequently got their label from the Latin <I>cardo</I>, meaning "hinge," beause they are pivotal:  All the other virtues, and the living of a virtuous life, depend on them.  If you took an introductory philosophy course in college, they were probably translated from the Greek as <I>courage, justice, temperance, and prudence</I>. [p.115]</blockquote>

<P>First of all, the cardinal virtues were not originated by "the Greeks," but by Plato, in the <a href="plato.htm"><I>Republic</I></a>.  Murray evades this perhaps because of his Aristotelian bias.  But it is a small thing in comparison to what comes next, for the virtues were not "probably" translated "courage, justice, temperance, and prudence," but "courage,  justice, temperance, and <I><B>wisdom</B></I>."  The Greek word in the end there is <img src="images/greek/sophia.gif" align=middle> (<I>soph&iacute;a</I>), not, as we might expect from Murray's earlier account, <img src="images/greek/prude.gif" align=middle> (<I>phr&oacute;n&ecirc;sis</I>), "practical wisdom."  This misrepresenation here is due to the Aristotelian basis of Murray'a account, which is unpacked as he explains "prudence":

<P><blockquote>That leaves <I>prudence</I>, the cardinal virtue that requires the most work and time for you to acquire.  it is also the virtue with the most unappealing label of all, with its connotation of timidity.  The idea of other people saying of me, "Charles is very prudent," is mortifying.  But this is a function of evolving langauge.  <I>Prudence</I> has acquired negative connotations that it did not formerly possess.  Let's go back to the original Greek word for this cardinal virtue, <I>phronesis</I>, which I introduced in tip #21. [p.116]</blockquote>

<P>This now makes explicit the error implicit in the earlier quote.  <I>Phr&oacute;n&ecirc;sis</I> is not the cardinal virtue, <I>soph&iacute;a</I> is.  And we see why Murray perpetrates this confusion in the following paragraph:

<P><blockquote>Aristotle talks about two kinds of wisdom.  One is the ability to apprehend reality and make the pieces fit together -- roughly, the kind of wisdom that underlies science.  <I>Phronesis</I> is the word Aristotle used for the other kind of wisdom, better translated in the twenty-first century as <I>practical wisdom</I>.  <I>Phronesis</I> is harder to come by than scientific knowledge.  Studying reality is not enough. [<I>ibid.</I>]</blockquote>

<P>Murray evades the fact that the first "kind of wisdom" is what Aristotle actually calls <I>soph&iacute;a</I>, whose most natural and traditional translations are <I>sapientia</I> in Latin and "wisdom" in English.  Since Murray himself then calls <I>phr&oacute;n&ecirc;sis</I> "practical wisdom," we might ask him what "wisdom" would mean without the "practical" part.  We don't get an answer to that in his book.  The reason for that is the reason that Murray avoids mentioning Plato.  For Socrates and Plato <I>soph&iacute;a</I> itself is practical, but in a way explicitly rejected by Aristotle -- who thinks that <I>phr&oacute;n&ecirc;sis</I> comes from <I>custom, habit, and experience</I>, not from answering the kinds of questions about the right and the good that were asked by Socrates.  Aristotle did not think that the answers Socrates was looking for even existed.

<P>As it happens, we can find in Plato a sort of pre-critique of Aristotle's view that ethics is a matter of, <img src="images/greek/habits.gif" align=middle>, "habits" (etc.).  I have considered this elsewhere, but the matter merits revisiting.  This is in the "<a href="plato.htm#er">Myth of Er</a>" in the <I>Republic</I>, where we find one of the dead, emerging from his reward in heaven for a good life, is required to choose the nature of the next life he will live.  He choses badly (like the villain in <I>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</I>, <I>q.v.</I>), foolishly attracted to the life of a tyrant, who unfortunately is fated "to eat his children and suffer other horrors" [<I>Republic</I>, 619b-c].  The judgment of this person fails because, Plato says, he had "some share of virtue which came by habit without philosophy."  Plato had elsewhere, in the <a href="knowledg.htm#note"><I>Meno</I></a>, considered the case of persons who were good out of habit, i.e. opinion [<img src="images/greek/doxa.gif" align=middle>, <I>d&oacute;xa</I>], and not out of knowledge or wisdom.  Without knowledge, they will be unable to judge the right and the good in circumstances incommensurate with their previous experience and habits.  Thus, Socrates explains to <a href="euthyph.htm#six">Euthyphro</a> that he wants a definition of piety so that "using it as a model [<I>par&aacute;deigma</I>]..." he can correctly judge "any actions of yours or another's that is of that kind..." [<I>Euthyphro</I>, 6e].  Without the "model," we may not know what we are looking at, regardless of our previous experience.

<P>Aristotle and Charles Murray are blind to these considerations.  The reason for such bias in Murray may come from a branch of <a href="quiz.htm">libertarian</a> thinking, inspired at least partially by <a href="rand.htm">Ayn Rand</a>, that Aristotle is the appropriate philosopher upon whom to found libertarian ideology -- although there is actually precious little of Aristotle that Rand actually uses.  This was always a bad idea, but it is also understandable given the association of Classical Liberal philosophy with British Empiricism (which can be favorably compared to Aristotle's epistemology), beginning with Locke, the preference of Plato for a dictatorial government by an elite of self-perpetuating expert "philosophers," which will offend and alarm libertarians, and then by a relative neglect, or distaste (because of Rand again), for a more correct treatment of the epistemology and metaphysics of ethics (i.e. meta-ethics) in <a href="moral-1.htm#note-1">Kant</a>.  There is a lot of work to be done there, and so it is not that surprising that Murray looks a bit lazy in his customary invocation of Aristotle.  Less forgivable is the misinformation.

<H3 ALIGN="center">The Polynomic Theory of Value, Note 5;<br>The Gap</H3>

<p><center><img src="images/key.gif"></center>

<P><img src="images/gap1.jpg" align=right width=200>The gap between women's thighs oddly has become a matter of some controversy.  This did not seem to be an issue during the initial vogue of tight bluejeans in the late 1970's.  These were so tight that women and girls often had some trouble pulling them on and then sitting down, and they seem to have experienced increases in vaginal infections from the lack of circulation of air (also a problem with the recently introduced pantyhose, which at first allowed no ventilation).

<P>I don't remember, however, the explicitness of the genital gap drawing much comment, unless the jeans were <I>so</I> tight that the form of the labia was evident.  <I>This</I> was regarded as too much (something about camels).  Now, however, when jeans and other tight clothes are still around, the argument seems to be that the gap only really exists if women are painfully thin or actually anorexic.  Fashion models with an obvious gap are bad examples, promoting "fat shaming" or eating disorders.<br clear=left>  

<P>Well, it may be that the thighs of healthy women are plump enough to close the gap, and fashion models do bear some resemblance to their functional equivalent -- <img src="images/gap.jpg" align=left width=300>clothes hangers -- but the gap itself reflects the structural space between where the thigh bones attach to the pelvis, which itself is wider than in men and allows space between the legs for the birth canal and the genitals, whose opening needs to be accessible.  I cannot say whether healthy thighs always close the gap or not, but in the video capture at left, from a Nivea lotion television ad, the model's skirt flares out -- as she twirls in joy at the experience of the product -- and we briefly see her thighs, which do not seem unusually spread.  There is a gap.  And the model, although certainly thin, does not seem anorexic.<br clear=right>

<P>Much the same could be said about Amal Clooney, <img src="images/amalcloo.jpg" align=right width=280>the impressive wife of actor George Clooney, right, at the Cannes Film Festival.  I am not sure what she is doing here, although it may be that she is untangling the dress that has become wrapped around her left leg, but this may show more than she intended.  <img src="images/beyonce.jpg" align=left width=150>It certainly shows a gap of pretty constant width from her knees up, up, up -- with very little "up" left to go.

<P>We also, curiously, see a gap through a dress worn by Beyonc&eacute;, at the Grammy Awards, at left.  The opaque flower design is conspicuously missing right at the top of her thighs, in otherwise all but transparent material.

<P>Although we might wonder if the model in the television ad above has her knees spread, both Amal Clooney and Beyonc&eacute; apparently have their knees slightly together, and the gap is nevertheless there.  This does seem more <I>anatomy</I> than <I>anorexia</I>  The whole business, really, seems to reflect some discomfort, on the part of both conservatives and feminists, for female anatomy and female sexuality.  Classical India seems all but unique in letting it all hang out..

<P>These difficulties may now be solved.  In 2015 Mt. Holyoke College cancelled performances of the "Vagina Monologues" because not all "women" have vaginas -- i.e. boys who say they are girls don't -- and in modern political correctness, these "trans-women" are just as much women as anatomical females.  Such "women" don't have the genital gap that goes with having a vagina, so, case closed.  And the "Vagina Monologues," which might have been criticized on various grounds, and gloried in its role to <I>&eacute;pater la bourgeoisie</I>, now is ironically beyond the pale of progressive politics.

<P>Meanwhile, anatomical males who are "self-identified" females have entered women's sports and defeated anatomical females, which seems to draw little protest from feminists -- who once had a negative opinion about this sort of thing -- and rarely even from (anatomical) women athletes.  <img src="images/gap2.jpg" width=250 align=right>The ones who do complain, even tennis great (and Lesbian) Martina Navratilova, are heatedly condemned.  They are supposed to shut up and let "women" with male genitals take over women's sports.

<P>Such are the curious, or insane, political convolutions of our times.  It also adds to the impression that political feminism will not gore any progressive oxen, regardless the effect on the status or fortunes of actual women.

<P>Another insane twist on this turned up in Baltimore, where Julia Beck, the only Lesbian on the Mayor's "LGBTQ Commission," was booted off, for "violence," because she had referred to a British "trans-gender" convicted rapist "woman" as a "he."  This is now the serious political crime of "misgendering."  This convicted rapist had been sent to a women's prison, where "she" then committed other rapes.  Beck's point was that allowing anatomical males to be treated like women endangers anatomical females, whose safe and private spaces are invaded by those who can harm them.  The evident and obvious common sense of this now escapes the good and the wise of political activism.  What they dare not do is ask Muslims whether they want anatomical males in women's bathrooms or locker rooms.  Since we know what the answer is going to be, the question doesn't get asked -- just as Muslim bakers are not asked to bake cakes for gay weddings.  The question, whether Muslim bakers would be willing, actually <I>has</I> gotten asked, to obvious results.

<P>Feminists might have seen this kind of thing coming.  The celebrated movie <I>The Crying Game</I> [1992] was deeply misogynistic.  Every female character was a treacherous villain, while the male character passing as a woman made a better woman, morally, than any of the real women.  From this we might gather that anatomical men should replace women as "women."  No one noticed this about the movie back in 1992.  But now, since this is actually happening in women's sports, and at least once even in a beauty contest, feminists, ever alert to patriarchal conspiracies, are suddenly blind and complacent.<br clear=left>

The <a href="key.htm#text">Boy Scout Law</a> and the <a href="key.htm#note">Seven Cardinal Virtues</a>, given elsewhere, are examples of virtues that are both moral virtues and virtues of prudence.  A list that is largely virtues of prudence is one made up by <B>Benjamin Franklin</B>, given at left, with Franklin's descriptions of what the virtues are about.  The two Cardinal virtues that figure here are given in color.  "Temperance" already has much of its purely modern meaning, about drinking, and so "Moderation" is highlighted as more like the traditional meaning.

<P>Franklin's intention was to concentrate on each virtue a week at a time to try and perfect himself.  Originally there were twelve in the table, but Franklin added "humility" when friends pointed out that it had been omitted, and that there was nothing specifically Christian about his list.  The virtue with the longest description, Chastity, may be the one with which Franklin had the most trouble -- he had an illegitimate child just before his marriage.  Later, Franklin lived many years in England without his wife but not without, it seems, female companionship (the <a href="http://www.benjaminfranklinhouse.org/">Benjamin Franklin House</a> in London has been restored, at 36 Craven Street, quite close to Charing Cross Station).  Franklin later became famous (or infamous) for his flirtations while he was the American representative in France during the Revolutionary War (which scandalized <a href="presiden.htm#2">John Adams</a>, to a degree that Franklin found bizarre).  But Franklin's later interest in women now mostly seems harmless, merely gallant, and teasing, since he was too old and ill, and his lovers too diffident, for matters to go very far.  Although there is sometimes talk along such lines, there is no credible evidence, or even serious claims, that Franklin ever had any other illegitimate children.<br clear=left>

<H3 ALIGN="center">John Wooden's Pyramid of Success</H3>

<p><center><img src="images/key.gif"></center>

<P><img src="images/wooden.jpg" align=left width=300><B>John Wooden</B> (1910-2010) was the basketball coach at UCLA from 1948 to 1975.  While Wooden quickly made UCLA basketball a successful program, beginning in 1964 the teams began to enjoy stratospheric success, winning 10 NCAA national championships until Wooden's retirement in 1975, including four seasons without a loss and a winning streak of 88 straight games.  He never asked for a raise and so never made more than $35,000 a year for his actual coaching job -- when in short order the coach of UCLA football would be the highest paid employee of the State of California, beating out the President of the University of California and the Governor of the <a href="ross/calif.htm">State</a>.  Although Wooden's teams were distinguished by extraordinary players, like Lew Alcindor (Kareem Abdul-Jabbar -- although Wooden continued to call him "Lewis"), 1966-1969, and Bill Walton, 1971-1974, Wooden won championships with teams that did not have either star on them -- and failed to win one in Walton's last season.

<P>Like Benjamin Franklin, Wooden compiled a list of virtues and moral precepts.  Unlike Franklin, he did this as a teacher for use in a pedagogic context.  Also, instead of just a list, Wooden organized his ideas systematically in a visual format.  This was Wooden's "Pyramid of Success," which was often <I>mentioned</I> in the course of his coaching career, but I never saw any formal presentation of it.  The testimony of his former players is that they often didn't appreciate it until later in life.  I have not heard how Wooden introduced it in the course of his coaching activities.  The "success" of this system, however, rested on an idiosyncratic definition:  &nbsp;"<B>Success is peace of mind which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you did your best to become the best that you are capable of becoming.</B>"  This is not what most athletic coaches, or sports fans, would think of as "success" in sports; and, indeed, Wooden rarely or never talked to his teams about actually winning their games.  This is "success" almost precisely as the form of <I>karmayoga</I> described by Krishna in the <a href="gita.htm"><I>Bhagavad G&icirc;ta</I></a>, <img src="images/greek/gita.gif" align=middle>.  Wooden may as well have told his players, as Krishna tells Arjuna, "In death thy glory in heaven, in victory thy glory on earth" [2:37, Juan Mascar&oacute; translation, Penguin Books, 1962].  Indeed, this appears to reflect Wooden's own Christian piety, certainly much more serious than Franklin's, although there was just never any public expression of it in his coaching career (no "Tebowing"), and there is only one small reference to "faith" in the Pyramid.  We find a mix here of a few moral virtues (e.g. honesty), many prudential ones (e.g. industriousness), and the sort of athletic attributes (e.g. condition, skill, team spirit) that we would expect.

<H3 ALIGN="center">The Polynomic Theory of Value, Note 7;<br>The Motive for the Right and the Good</H3>

<P><center><img src="images/key-g.gif"></center>

<P><blockquote><font size=+1>Many people still believe that they ought to do something simply because it is right, or refrain from doing it simply because it is wrong, not because they are terrified by the spectre of the police, judges, prison or execution.  My naive question is:  &nbsp;could mankind survive without such people?  And my answer is no.</font>

<P>Leszek Ko&#x0142;akowski (1927-2009), "Crime and Punishment," <I>Is God Happy? Selected Essays</I> [Basic Books, 2013, p.239]</blockquote>

<P><center><img src="images/bar-g.gif"></center>

<P><img src="images/wrap-10.gif" align=left>The <a href="key.htm#virtues">Chinese virtues</a> shown in this diagram match up nicely not only with the categories of virtues shown (including virtues of <a href="moral-2.htm">moral intention</a>) but with a <a href="types.htm#kant">typology</a> that can be constructed around Chinese and Kantian ethics.

<P>Here I might address the issue treated by Plato in the <a href="plato.htm">Republic</a>:  &nbsp;Why be just, <img src="images/greek/dikaios.gif" align=middle>?  In other words, what reason have we got to be good and do the right?  Or, in the morality of intentions, why should we mean well,  be of good faith and good will, and try to do the right thing?  What purpose does it serve, or how would it otherwise be justified?

<P>Plato's own answer is actually one of <font color="#0000ff"><B>Prudence:  &nbsp;To be happy</B></font>.  The just man is the happy man, or "virtue is its own reward," as the <a href="hist-1.htm#hellen">Stoics</a> would subsequently assert.  Perhaps feeling that not everyone would believe this, Plato added, <font color="#0000ff"><B>to gain reward and avoid punishment in the afterlife</B></font>.  This becomes a popular reason to motivate morality, as we find Jesus saying, "<font color="#0000ff"><B>But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou has shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly</B></font>" [Matthew 6:6].  A reward in life or in Heaven is the promise of Christianity and other religions, as we also see through the doctrine of <a href="karma.htm">karma</a>.

<P>The answer we find in Kant and in Confucius is rather different, that <font color="#00cc00"><B>We do what is right for its own sake, just because it is right</B></font>.  Kant's calls this the "<a href="domain.htm#modes">categorical imperative</a>," a command without ulterior motive or self-interested purpose.  Confucius expressed it nicely as, <img src="images/hiero/superman.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/understg.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/referg.gif" align=middle><img src="images/yi3.gif" align=middle>, <font color="#00cc00"><B>"The superior man thinks of what is right;" <img src="images/hiero/smallg.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/persong.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/understg.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/referg.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/lig.gif" align=middle> "The mean man thinks of profit"</B></font> [<a href="confuciu.htm#right"><I>Analects</I></a> IV:16].  We also see something similar expressed in the <a href="gita.htm#text-1"><I>Bhagavad Gita</I></a>, where Krishna says, <img src="images/greek/imperatg.gif" align=middle>, <font color="#00cc00"><B>"Set thy heart upon thy work, but never on its reward," <img src="images/greek/imperath.gif" align=middle>, "Work not for a reward; but never cease to do thy work"</B></font> [2:47].  The idea that goodness earns a Reward in Heaven Krishna dismisses with, "...their heaven is a selfish desire...the reward of which is earthly rebirth" [2:43].

<P>A third motive for right action might be <font color="#eeaa00"><B>Embarrassment.  Propriety</B></font> is about appearances.  You avoid wrongful action because you might not want people to think ill of your family, your parents, or perhaps your origins.  <img src="images/wrap-10.gif" align=left>There is a saying in <a href="sangoku.htm#modern">Japanese</a>, that <font color="#eeaa00"><B>when you are away from home, the neighbors do not know what you are doing.</B></font>  This is often said to express the standards of a culture of <font color="#eeaa00"><B>shame</B></font> rather than of <B>guilt</B>.  What you may have done is of no concern, as long as people think well of you.  You have your <font color="#eeaa00"><B>honor</B></font> to uphold, which means that an <I>insult</I> may be more objectionable than substantive harm to person or property.  Insult, by you or to you, is avoided through good manners.  It is noteworthy that in American gang culture, which has seeped into general popular culture, being "dissed," or <font color="#eeaa00"><B>disrespected</B></font>, is an offense to one's honor that is liable to lead to violence, as much as for any Spanish <I>Hidalgo</I> or other European <a href="rank.htm#feudal">aristocrat</a>.

<P>A fourth motive for right action is <font color="#ff0000"><B>Sympathy</B></font>.  This is eloquently stated by <a href="arthur.htm">Schopenhauer</a>, who says, "All love (<img src="images/greek/agape.gif" align=middle>, caritas</I>) is compassion or sympathy" [<I>The World as Will and Representation</I>, Volume I, &sect;66, Dover Publications, 1966, E.F.J. Payne translation, p.374]:

<P><blockquote>...such a man, recognizing in all beings his own true and innermost self, must also regard the endless sufferings of all that lives as his own, and thus take upon himself the pain of the whole world.  No suffering is any longer strange or foreign to him. [<I>ibid.</I>, &sect;68, p.379]</blockquote>

<P>This is not unfamiliar from Confucius, who says that <img src="images/ren3.gif" align=middle> is to "<font color="#ff0000"><B>Love others</B></font>," <img src="images/hiero/love.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/personr.gif" align=middle> [<I>Analects</I> <a href="confuciu.htm#love">XII:22</a>], or Jesus, "<font color="#ff0000"><B>Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself</B></font>" [Matthew 19:19].  Now, one cannot choose how to feel, so love as a feeling cannot be morally commanded.  While <a href="god.htm#love">love</a> may motivate moral action, it is not a duty and is not choice, so, as Kant says, "this by itself cannot be reckoned as a particular merit of the person."  It is just the way they are.  If, however, one does feel sympathy for others, then the motive for moral action is obvious:  &nbsp;to avoid inflicting pain.

<P><img src="images/wrap-10.gif" align=left>The basic answer to Plato's question is that <font color="#00cc00"><B>one does what is right just because it is right</B></font>.  The other motives, <font color="#0000ff"><B>prudence</B></font>, <font color="#eeaa00"><B>propriety</B></font>, and <font color="#ff0000"><B>sympathy</B></font>, are indeed goods, but they are not duties and are not <I>morally</I> laudable.  Since they are not duties, someone may not think that there are good reasons why they should even care about them.  Prudence is an appeal to self-interest, and that may actually strike many as a motivation <I>contrary</I> to morality, which limits self-interest.  Propriety means worrying about what other people think, but the judgments and perhaps the bigotries of others are no sure guide to value.  As <a href="feynman.htm">Richard Feynman's</a> wife told him, "What do you care what other people think?"  Finally, sympathy, while it seems the humane accompaniment to moral action, which might seem rather cold otherwise, is not necessary to it and may actually lead one astray with an indulgent attitude towards the moral weaknesses of others.  The naively sympathetic person can be manipulated by others who have learned to avoid responsibility by appearing helpless.  The proper response to that may appear distinctly unsympathetic, i.e. "tough love."  One would certainly be accused of being uncaring.

<P>However, all of these motivations are valuable to an extent and in their own right.  They can all function as a system of <I>checks and balances</I> when, as Kant himself at one point admitted, someone acting on principle has chosen the wrong principle and only causes harm (<I>damnum</I>).  Thus, the Communist Party agent who sets out to seize food from Ukrainians, on the principle that they are "Kulaks" and are hoarding food, may realize that they are thereby leaving them to starve to death.  Properly governed by the Party Line, the agent may not care, or may think that they deserve it; but the <I>humanity</I> (<img src="images/ren3.gif" align=middle>) of the agent, with some feeling for the victims, may nevertheless be given pause.  That so few of them questioned their actions was no tribute to Marxist and Soviet ideology, or to human nature in general.

<P>In my <a href="./valley/">classes</a>, what I wanted was that anyone should feel that a relevant, sincere belief could be expressed about any matter, however offensive it might seem to some.  But for there to be orderly discussion a certain level of civility must be maintained.  That requires a certain exercise of good manners, without insults, personal hostility, etc.  Otherwise, there may not be a moral or political crime, but there <I>is</I> a failure to have a viable forum for discussion or disputation; and I would ask anyone to leave who is not able to maintain decorum.

<P>As it happened, in twenty-two years of full-time teaching, following eleven years, off-and-on, of part-time teaching as a graduate student, nothing like personal insults or hostility had ever really been an issue.  I did ask one student to leave the class after he said I was lying that I had only smoked marijuana <a href="ross/ross-4.htm#inhale">once</a> back in the 60's.  That didn't come up again.

<p><center><img src="images/key.gif"></center>

<P>Something that is noteworthy about the series of books of which <I>Silence of the Lambs</I> was a part, which began with <I>Red Dragon</I> (1981), is the triumph of a <a href="poly-1b.htm#text-8">moral aestheticism</a> in the third book, <I>Hannibal</I> (1999).  Hannibal goes from being the anti-hero of the first two books, contrasted with the goodness of the agents who had to deal with him, to being the out and out hero of the third, to the extent of converting agent Clarice Starling to his way of life.  Because of this development, Foster and the director of <I>Silence of the Lambs</I>, Jonathan Demme, passed on participation in the production of the movie <I>Hannibal</I> (2001), which was then directed by Ridley Scott.

<P>They need not have worried.  The makers of <I>Hannibal</I> themselves recoiled from the direction of the story and released an ending in which Hannibal simply gets away again -- selflessly sacrificing his hand for Clarice!  This was absurd.  Harris had obviously lost it and been won over by the daemonic attraction of his fictional villain; but if this is what has happened, it is ridiculous to try and patch it up in Hollywood -- though such cosmetics are not without precedent.  More interesting is the commitment here to righteouness rather than aestheticism, something more difficult to believe from many other Hollywood movies. 

<P>Will Tommy Lee Jones, the U.S. Marshall from <I>The Fugitive</I> (1993), now pursue the "one-handed" rather than the "one-armed" man?  As a practical matter, this would make it much, much more difficult to Lecter to travel or live in disguise.

<P>The Italian episode within the movie <I>Hannibal</I> is nicely done and contains interesting references to the Pazzi family in the history of <a href="italia.htm#tuscany">Florence</a>.

<P><img src="images/villers.jpg" width=200 align=right>I cannot resist noting the striking contrast between the portrait from 1801 by Marie-Denise Villers and the one below left, from 1837 by Samuel F.B. Morse.  This is of Morse's own daughter Susan Walker Morse (1819-1885).  Both paintings are in the collection of the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art.

<P>The <I>Empire</I> clothing of 1801 is light and flowing and drapes naturally over the body.  The setting is naturalistic, with the figure looking easily at the artist, as though she is sketching the artist in turn, and may very well be in the act of doing so.  We might wonder if Villers and du Val d'Ognes were actually friendly with each other -- both were young -- and the inspiration of the painting may have been an occasion when they were engaged in mutual sketching.  The back-lit figure, sitting in natural sunlight, seems to me unusual to unique in art I have seen of the era, or any era.  There is a French word for this, however, <I>contre-jour</I>, for a figure backlit in particular by daylight, perhaps more often used in photography than for painting.  But that is what we see here.  The background, also, contains two small figures and a building that almost seem lifted from some later Surrealistic art.  In short, this is an extraordinary painting in both syle and conception.  And she is a lovely <a href="erotic.htm#dress">girl</a>.

<P><img src="images/morse00.jpg" width=375 align=left>The Morse portrait, however, has a very different character.  The setting seems allegorical, with the silhoutte of a neo-classical vase, against a distant sunset -- a background I have reduced, so what I show here is only a detail of the larger painting -- a sunset that, of course, can contribute nothing to the way the foreground scene is lit, which in turn looks like a theatrical spotlight is being used.  The figure of Miss Morse looks away, as though thinking about what to draw, although we can see that she has not yet drawn anything.  Most striking, however, is her clothing, which, a long way from 1801, has become heavy, voluminous, and stiff.  This does not look comfortable, or suitable for an art studio, although its features would not be unusual in the 17th or 18th centuries.  This clothing reminds me of an awful early movie of <I>Pride and Prejudice</I> [1940], with Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier, which used this kind of clothing instead of the contemporary style of Jane Austen.

<P>This seems to have been one of Morse's last paintings, since he moved from art to inventing, and was already at this time inventing the telegraph.  The modernity of electronic communication resonates more with the <I>modernity</I> of the style of 1801 than with that of 1837.  The clothing of 1801 bespeaks a social <I>loosening</I>, which is characteristic of the Revolutionary Era, and of the 20th century, more than the <I>stiffening</I> of Victorian society and styles evident in 1837, the actual year of Queen Victoria's <a href="perifran.htm#potato">accession</a>.  The figure of the 1801 painting also seems <I>assertive</I> in a modern way, as we see her in the act of drawing and looking directly at the artist and viewer.  Even her <I>posture</I> is more active, leaning up into the act of drawing, while Miss Morse is sitting back.  The feminist might think that the woman artist is showing an active woman, while father Morse sees a more passive, introverted, abstracted daughter -- not in the least challenging to anything.<br clear=left>

<P>I cannot account for the phenomenon of being all but transfixed by a newly encountered piece of music.  In 2012 this happened to me twice.  The first example came from listening to different excerpts of the <I>Terpsichore</I> collection by Michael Praetorius (1571-1621).  There are 300 some dances in <I>Terpsichore</I>, named after the <a href="greek.htm#justify">Muse of Dance</a>.  Performances and CD's thus rely on a few favorites and other random selections.  Owning a number of <I>Terpsichore</I> CD's, I had never gotten around to listening to all of them even after many years.  One disk I had neglected was the Arabesque Recordings collection conducted by Sally Logemann [Z6531, 1985].  Finally playing the whole thing through, and liking all the music just fine, there was one in particular that absolutely gripped me and stood out, as <a href="arthur.htm ">Schopenhauer</a> says, "preserved like a meteorite, sprung from an order of things different from that which prevails here" [<I>The World as Will and Representation</I>, Volume I, 59, Dover Publications, 1966, E.F.J. Payne translation, p.324].  This was the 10th cut on the CD, listed by Logemann in the "Suite No.2 in G Major," and called the <I>Bransle de montirande</I> [the modern spelling of <I>bransle</I>, "shaking, dance, brawl," is <I>branle</I>, which is actually pronounced /<B>br&atilde;l</B>/].  I don't know what it is about this piece.  In dignity, majesty, and seriousness it seems altogether different from any other selections I have heard from <I>Terpsichore</I>.  It is truly sublime, limited only by its brevity and its restricted range of variation, which perhaps are characteristic of the era and style.  But it is the sort of thing that I am almost compelled to play over and over again, until I am exhausted with it, like the first weeks with a new lover.

<P>A similar experience occurred in a recent movie, the quite unnecessary remake of <I>Total Recall</I> [2012].  Unlike the original movie [1990], a piece of piano music is the key to our hero (Colin Farrell) discovering his original identity.  Very little of the piece is heard in the movie.  I did not recognize it, but it was sufficiently attractive that I watched the credits carefully to learn its identity.  <img src="images/beethove.jpg" align=right>It was the third movement, <I>Allegretto</I>, from Beethoven's Sonata No. 17 in F Minor (Op.31 No.2), "La Tempesta," named after the fact for Shakespeare's <a href="tempest.htm"><I>The Tempest</I></a>.  This music alone was worth the price of admission to the movie.  Now, I am familiar enough with Beethoven's symphonies, which I have actually played in their entirety while <a href="./ross/drives.htm#2009">driving</a> across the country, but I have never made a systematic study of the rest of his music.  I was not familiar at all with Sonata No. 17.  In fact, I still have not listened carefully to the first two movements.  It is the third that I found gripping and sublime and that had this transfixing effect.  It is still hard to say what it is about it; but it is truly extraordinary, which makes me wonder why for decades I had not heard it someplace already.  I think it is one of the truly great moments in the Beethoven <I>opera</I>.  If it then pops up in a movie that is largely a mediocre remake, perhaps the world is not too <a href="decdenc1.htm">decadent</a> after all.

<P>In 2011 there was also a movie, <I>The Tree of Life</I>, that featured a particularly striking piece of music.  The movie was director Terrence Malick's (b.1943) meditation on the death of his brother and their childhood together in Texas, although it is a little difficult to tell what the background was from the internal evidence of the movie alone.  There was a great deal of classical music in the movie, which apparently was substituted for most of the score that was actually written for the film.  One of the most conspicuous items was of classical form but of recent provenance.  This was used early in the movie for a section of striking images, called "Creation" on the DVD, which featured photos of galaxies, nebulae, and other forms suggestive of the universe, or of the early universe.  The music for this was from Polish composer Zbigniew Preisner's (b.1955) <I>Requiem for My Friend</I> (1998), <I>Requiem Dla Mojego Przyjaciela</I>.

Since this is a Catholic requiem mass, the words are familiar from that ritual.  "Creation" uses the <I>Lacrimosa</I>, "Most Tearful," part of the mass.

<P>Apart from the considerable beauty of the music, which had an effect on me such as I have been describing, there is the considerable irony of its use in this context.  As we see the images of the beauty of the universe, with the suggestion of the beauty of God's Creation, we are nevertheless <I>hearing</I> words that describe the trauma, grief, and danger of the Judgment Day, when there will be a reckoning for our <a href="moral-1.htm#crime">sins</a>, which of course occurs, not at the time of Creation, but at the <I>end</I> of the universe.  This contrast will likely be lost on the casual moviegoer, who probably will not recognize the meaning of the words in Latin.  Indeed, at first viewing, I don't think I even realized that the often repeated refrain was <I>lacrimosa</I>, familiar as the word "lacrimose" in English.  Once we do realize that the words form a counterpoint to the images, it is hard not to understand that Malick's assertion is that suffering is inherent in the world right from the beginning.  This is not quite orthodox Catholic doctrine, which would only be that this is the case after the Fall, but it is close.  As such it puts the whole movie in perspective.  Why is there death and loss, as of Malick's brother?  It is unavoidable.  While this creates a theological problem for Christianity, whose God is responsible for this circumstance, especially if we back-date it to the Creation, the sentiment will be no different from that of <a href="buddhism.htm">Buddhism</a>, where the proximate blame is on us, for our own ignorance and desire, but where the ultimate responsibility for the natue of things is unknown.  The suffering of the world is simply a given.

<P>Thus, experiencing great beauty by sight and music, we are driven to reflect on the imperfection and impermanence of life.  This is a rare thing for Hollywood, and ideologically opposed to most of the moral and political messages that are to be found, often in the crudest forms, in its work -- although not too suprising in an idiosyncratic director like Terrence Malick, who has always been an outsider to the Hollywood system and its culture (although one of the actors in <I>The Tree of Life</I>, <a href="newspain.htm#granada">Sean Penn</a>, is one of the worst offenders when it comes to grotesque political commitments).  The seriousness of the <I>Lacrimosa</I> and its use thus contrasts with the incidental use of Beethoven in <I>Total Recall</I>, or of the secular and courtly provenance of Praetorius's <I>Bransle de montirande</I>.
