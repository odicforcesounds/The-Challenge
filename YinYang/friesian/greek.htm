<H1 ALIGN="center">The Origin of Philosophy:<br>The Attributes of Mythic/<br>Mythopoeic Thought</H1>

<P><center><img src="images/key.gif"></center>

<P>The pioneering work on this subject was <I>The Intellectual Adventure of Ancient Man, An Essay on Speculative Thought in the Ancient Near East</I> by Henri Frankfort, H.A. Frankfort, John A. Wilson, Thorkild Jacobsen, and William A. Irwin (University of Chicago Press, 1946, 1977 -- also once issued by Penguin as <I>Before Philosophy</I>).  Related ideas can also be found in Henri Frankfort's great <I>Ancient Egyptian Religion</I> (Harper Torchbooks, Harper & Row, 1948, 1961)<p>

<P>How was Greek philosophy different from what came before?  Or was it different?  Even though "philosophy," <img src="images/greek/philosop.gif" align=middle>, <I>philosoph&iacute;a</I>, is a Greek word (rendered into <a href="hist-1.htm#islam">Arabic</a> as <img src="images/greek/falsafah.gif">, <I>falsafah</I>), from <img src="images/greek/philein.gif" align=middle>, <I>phile&icirc;n</I>, "to love," and <img src="images/greek/sophia.gif" align=middle>, <I>soph&iacute;a</I>, "wisdom," perhaps it was just a continuation of how people had always thought about things anyway.  After all, it is not uncommon now for items of Egyptian literature, like the <I>Instruction of Ptah.h.otep</I>, to be listed and taught as Egyptian "philosophy" (although the <a href="notes/oldking.htm#tale"><I>Tale of the Eloquent Peasant</I></a> contains principles superior to much modern <a href="econ.htm#law">jurisprudence</a>)  So if Greek philosophy is to be thought of as different, there must be ways of specifying that difference.  Similarly, if Greek philosophy is to be compared with <a href="history.htm#india">Indian</a> (<img src="images/greek/philosin.gif" align=middle><img src="images/greek/shastra.gif" align=middle>, <I>darshana-sh&acirc;stra</I>) and <a href="history.htm#china">Chinese</a> (<img src="images/hiero/philos2.gif" align=middle>; Japanese <I>tetsugaku</I>) philosophy, there must be something that they have in common, and that can be mutually contrasted with pre-philosophical thought.

<P><a name="love"><blockquote>To pause for a moment, "philosopher" in Greek was <img src="images/greek/philosof.gif" align=middle>, <I>phil&oacute;sophos</I> (plural <img src="images/greek/philosos.gif" align=middle>, <I>phil&oacute;sophoi</I>) -- this turns up in Arabic again as <img src="images/greek/faylasuf.gif" align=middle>, <I>faylas&ucirc;f</I> (with a "broken" or irregular plural <img src="images/greek/falasifa.gif" align=middle>, <I>fal&acirc;sifah</I>).  The grammatical form of <img src="images/greek/philosof.gif" align=middle> is a (second declension) masculine, but compounds like this retain second declension endings even when they are used in the feminine gender.  So a Greek woman who was a philosopher was still a <img src="images/greek/philosof.gif" align=middle>.  But a "friend" who is a <img src="images/greek/philos.gif" align=middle>, <I>ph&iacute;los</I>, is male, while a female "friend" (or "<a href="feminism.htm#alcestis">beloved</a>") is a <img src="images/greek/love-f.gif" align=middle>, <I>ph&iacute;l&ecirc;</I>.  A striking example of this grammar was the patron goddess of Athens, <img src="images/greek/athena.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/partheno.gif" align=middle>, <B>Athena Parthenos</B>, or Athena "the Virgin."  But "the Virgin," <img src="images/greek/the-fem.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/partheno.gif" align=middle>, is in the feminine gender, taking the feminine article, despite the apparently masculine ending.  Other common nouns in Greek are second declension feminines, without being compounds, like  <img src="images/greek/the-fem.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/hodos.gif" align=middle>, <I>h&ecirc; hod&oacute;s</I>, "the way, road, street" -- so that "the Middle [Street]" in <a href="decdenc1.htm#constantinople">Constantinople</a>, <img src="images/greek/the-fem.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/mese-cap.gif" align=middle> [<img src="images/greek/hodos.gif" align=middle>], <I>h&ecirc; M&eacute;s&ecirc; [hod&oacute;s}</I>, was the street that ran the length of the City, from the Golden Gate to the Great Palace.  "Middle" here, <img src="images/greek/mese.gif" align=middle>, an adjective, is inflected in the feminine.  In Latin, not observing the same scuples as Greek grammar, <I>philosophus</I> is masculine and <I>philosopha</I> feminine.  In Mediaeval Greek, the use of second declension endings for feminine compound nouns began to break down, which we see in the interesting case of the "Born in the Purple," <img src="images/greek/porphyrp.gif" align=middle>, Princess <a href="romania.htm#declension">Anna Comnena</a></blockquote>

<P>As it happens, Greek philosophy, and Indian and Chinese, <B>were</B> different from what came before; and we can specify what the differences were.  Pre-philosophical thought can be characterized as "mythopoeic," "mythopoetic," or "mythic" thought.  "Mythopoeic" means "making" (<img src="images/greek/poiein.gif" align=middle>, <I>poie&icirc;n</I>, from which the word "poet" is derived) "myth" (<img src="images/greek/mythos.gif" align=middle>, <I>m&ucirc;thos</I>).  There is a large and growing literature about mythology, but here all that is necessary are the points what will serve the purpose of distinguishing philosophical thought from the thought of people in earlier Middle Eastern civilizations (Egyptians, Babylonians, etc.) about the nature of things.  With the identification of the characteristics of mythic forms of human thought, it becomes possible to identify the unique innovations of philosophy.  Note that philosophic thought does not <I>replace</I> mythopoeic thought but <I>supplements</I> it.

<P><ol>
<li><a name="stories">Myths are <I>stories about persons</I></a>, where persons may be gods, heroes, or ordinary people.

<P><ul><li><B>Example</B>:  The Babylonian <I>Epic of Gilgamesh</I>.  King <a href="notes/oldking.htm#sumer">Gilgamesh</a> seeks to become immortal, after the death of his friend Enkidu, but fails.  This is still a poignant story, since human beings still face loss and grief and death, just as did Gilgamesh.  Indeed, Enkidu's vision of death is still chilling:

<P><blockquote>There is the house whose people sit in darkness; dust is their food and clay their meat.  They are clothed like birds with wings for covering, they see no light, they sit in darkness.  I entered the house of dust and I saw the kings of the earth, their crowns put away for ever... [N. K. Sanders, Penguin, 1964, p. 89]</blockquote>

<P>Where Gigamesh finds the plant of immortality (or at least restored youth), on the floor of the sea, was at "Dilmun," which now is identified as modern Bahrain, <a href="notes/breast.htm#note-1"><img src="images/greek/bahrain2.gif" align=middle border=0></a> -- a name that means "Two Seas," apparently in reference the salt waters of the Persian Gulf and the fresh water springs on the floor of the Gulf near Bahrain -- the reason why many people, besides Gilgamesh, were swimming down to the bottom, to refill water skins.  This gives an extra verisimilitude to the story, making it credible that Gilgamesh, hero or not, would be able to swim to the bottom.  It does, however, leave him tired enough that he naps before eating the plant, by which he loses it, rendering his quest futile.

<P>The story of Gilgamesh and Enkidu is used in a <a href="trek.htm"><I>Star Trek: The Next Generation</I></a> episode, "Darmok" [aired 30 September 1991, season #5, show #2].  Captain Picard is trapped with an alien captain, who communicates with allusions to stories.  Picard uses the story of Gilgamesh.  However, the alien captain, like Enkidu, having become a friend, then dies.  Thus, one of the oldest stories in history remains grist for modern science fiction.

<P><li><B>Changed in Philosophy</B>:  Thales' proposed a theory of earthquakes, that they are just when a wave in the cosmic ocean rocks the earth, which floats like a plate on the ocean.  This explanation eliminated the actions or intentions of the gods.</ul><P>

<li><a name="egypt">Myth allows for a <I>multiplicity of explanations</I>, where the explanations are not logically exclusive (can contradict each other) and are often humorous.

<P><ul><li><B>Example</B>:  The Egyptian sun god R&ecirc;</a> (<I>R'</I>, probably vocalized <a href="egypt.htm"><I>R&icirc;</I>'</a>), <img src="images/hiero/re-2.gif" align=middle>, appears in various forms.  R&ecirc; Atum (<I>R' 'Itm</I>), <img src="images/hiero/atum.gif" align=middle>, is a god in human form, with a blue skin, who sails across the sky in a boat [<a href="#note-0">note</a>].

<P><img src="images/hiero/Horakhti.gif" align="left"><img src="images/hiero/Horus.gif" align="right">R&ecirc;-Horakht&icirc; (<I>R' H.r-'<U>kh</U>ty</I>), <img src="images/hiero/horakht2.gif" align=middle>, combines R&ecirc; with the god Horus, a hawk who flies across the sky -- one eye is the sun, the other eye, injured when Horus was fighting his uncle Seth is the moon, <img src="images/phases-0.gif" align=middle>, which we could say is not only dim but <I>blinks</I> like an injured eye.

<P>And R&ecirc;-Khepere (<I>R' <U>Kh</U>pri</I>), <img src="images/hiero/khepere.gif" align=middle>, is R&ecirc; in the form of a scarab beetle [<a href="#note-00">note</a>].  The scarab lays its eggs in a ball of dung, which it then pushes around before it.  The Egyptians thus saw the sun as analogous to the dung (!) being pushed around by the beetle.  This suggests another possible characteristic of mythopoeic thought:  &nbsp;that it doesn't always seem serious.  Such a characteristic stands in stark contrast to attitudes in later religion, which often seem markedly <a href="poly-1b.htm#religious">anhedonic</a> and <a href="wisdom.htm#laugh">humorless</a>.  Although it was later tempting to systematize the different forms of R&ecirc; as embodied in the sun at different times of day, there was never much of a coherent theory that could be made of this (any more than with the Egyptian <a href="soul.htm#egypt">soul</a>).  A similar problem occurs in India with the juxtaposition of the great sectarian Gods, <a href="gods.htm">Vis.n.u and Shiva</a>, though there is an effective systematization on the philosophical side of Hinduism.<br clear=left>

<P><li><B>Changed in Philosophy</B>:  The theories of the earliest Greeks philosophers, especially those about whom we know the most, like Anaximander and Heraclitus, are systematic and internally coherent.  Inconsistency is grounds for criticism, or, as practiced by Socrates, <a href="foundatn.htm">falsification</a>.</ul><P>

<li><a name="akhenaton">Mythic traditions are <I>conservative</I>.  Innovation is slow, and radical departures from tradition rarely tolerated.

<P><ul><li><img src="images/akhnaton.gif" align="right"><B>Example</B>:  The Egyptian king <a href="notes/newking.htm#18">Akhenaton</a> (<I>'Khnitn</I>) <img src="images/hiero/akhen.gif" align=middle>, who introduced a monotheistic cult of one God, the sun god Aton (<I>'Itn</I>), and abolished the worship of all the other traditional Egyptian gods.  He was branded the "Criminal of Amarna" (the city he built to the Aton, in Egyptian <I>'Kht-itn</I>, "Akhet-Aton," or the "Horizon of the Aton").  His name and memory, and those of three subsequent kings (including Tutankhamon, whose tomb was discovered in 1922), were erased from Egyptian history by the succeeding King Haremhab.  Shown at right are Akhenaton and Queen Nefertiti making offerings to the disk and rays of the Aton.  Also evident is an example of the strange Manneristic artistic style used for Akhenaton that gives him a feminized figure, in this case an even more exaggerated one than for Nefertiti.  Why Akhenaton looks this way is a matter of controversy -- it may have been a disease, though this would have made him sterile, which he was not, or some kind of ideological statement, the way the Nile god Hapi is always shown with breasts, which is possible.  Akhenaton also mandated the literary use of the spoken language.  Thus, we find the use of the article "the," <I>pa</I>, which did not exist in Classical Middle Egyptian but was present in the New Egyptian of the XVIII Dynasty.  Thus we know it was "the Aton," <img src="images/hiero/the-pa.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/aton.gif" align=middle>, <I>pa-Aton</I>.<br clear=right>

<P><li><B>Changed in Philosophy</B>:  Greek philosophy represented a burst of creativity.  While Thales' views about water reflected long held mythic accounts (both Egyptian, Babylonian, and Biblical creation stories begin with water), he was immediately superseded by the multiple novel theories of Anaximander, Anaximenes, Xenophanes, Pythagoras, and Heraclitus, all within 80 years.</ul><P>

<li><a name="justify">Myths are <I>self-justifying</I></a>.  The inspiration of the gods was enough to ensure their validity, and there was no other explanation for the creativity of poets, seers, and prophets than inspiration by the gods.  Thus, myths are <I>not argumentative</I>.  Indeed, they often seem most unserious, humorous, or flippant (e.g. R&ecirc;-Khepere above).  It still seems to be a psychological truth that people who think of new things are often persuaded of their truth just because they thought of them.  And now, oddly, we are <B>without</B> an explanation for creativity.

<B>Example</B>:  Homer addresses an unnamed goddess (<img src="images/greek/thea-2.gif" align=middle>, <I>the&aacute;</I>) or the <B>Muses</B> (<img src="images/greek/muses.gif" align=middle>, <I>Mo&ucirc;sai</I> -- which gives us words like "museum" and "music") at the beginning of the <I>Iliad</I> (depending on our version of the text -- it is not uncommon to avoid naming a god that is to be invoked, as Socrates never does name Apollo as "the god at Delphi" in the <a href="apology.htm"><I>Apology</I></a>).  The Nine Muses in Greek Mythology are uniquely charged with inspiring creativity.  Note that there are no Muses of plastic arts (painting, sculpture, architecture), or of philosophy:  &nbsp;This must mean that the myth of the Muses was finalized before the advent of philosophy or of significant stone architecture.  Note, however, that "history," <img src="images/greek/history.gif" align=middle>, <I>histor&iacute;a</I>, originally just meant "learning by inquiry."  This could easily include philosophy and many other things.

<P>A memorable tribute to the Muses may be found in the music of the German composer Michael Praetorius (Pr&auml;torius, c.1571-1621), who published a two volume collection of 312 short dance tunes called <I>Terpsichore</I>.  He also produced similar collections of hymns, the <I>Polyhymnia</I>, and collections of secular music for comedy and idyllic and lyric poetry, the <I>Thalia</I> and <I>Erato</I>.

<P><li><B>Changed in Philosophy</B>:  <a href="#parmenides">Parmenides</a>, after the invocation of an unnamed goddess in his poem, <I>The Way of Truth</I>, offers substantive arguments for his views.  We see similar transitions in <a href="history.htm#china">Chinese</a> (<img src="images/hiero/philos2.gif" align=middle>; Japanese <I>tetsugaku</I>) and <a href="history.htm#india">Indian</a> (<img src="images/greek/philosin.gif" align=middle><img src="images/greek/shastra.gif" align=middle>, <I>darshana-sh&acirc;stra</I>) philosophy, where at the beginning there are only the aphoristic assertions of <a href="confuciu.htm">Confucius</a> or the <a href="taote.htm"><I>Tao Te Ching</I></a> and texts like the <a href="upan.htm#manduk">M&acirc;n.d.&ucirc;kya Upanis.ad</a>.</ul><br clear=right>

<li><a name="morally">Myths are <I>morally ambivalent</I>.</a>  The gods and heroes do not always do what is right or admirable, and mythic stories do not often have edifying moral lessons to teach.

<P><ul><li><B>Example</B>:  <img src="images/hiero/Seth.gif" align="left"><img src="images/hiero/Isis.gif" align="right">The Egyptian god Seth (<I>St</I>) murdered and dismembered his brother Osiris (<I>Wsir</I>) and is later attacked for this by Osiris's son Horus.  But Seth is then forgiven by Isis (<I>'St</I>), his sister and the wife of Osiris and mother of Horus, even though Seth had badly damaged Horus's eye in their fight.  The "Eye of Horus," <img src="images/hiero/eye.gif" align=middle>, subsequently (ironically?) becomes a symbol of healing.

<P>When Seth initially murdered Osiris, he simply tossed the body in the Nile.  <img src="images/beirut03.jpg" width=300 align=right>It was washed up at the Phoenician city of <a href="#note-5">Byblos</a>, where a tree actually grew up around it and Isis later found it.  At right are the remains of the wells at Byblos, where Isis was supposedly recognized.

<P>Isis brought the body back to Egypt, where Seth stole it, cut it up, and scattered the parts around the country.  Isis patiently retrieved them all, except, reportedly, for the genitals.  The god Anubis brought Osiris back to life, and supplied magically animated wooden genitals, with which Isis conceived Horus.

<P>The Egyptians were clearly aware of the moral terms of this story.  King <a href="notes/newking.htm#19">Seti I</a>, who built a great temple to Osiris at Abydos, the cult center of Osiris, was named after Seth (<I>Sty</I>, <img src="images/hiero/seti.gif" align=middle>) and so politely alters his name in the temple inscriptions to commemorate Osiris (<I>Wsiry</I>, <img src="images/hiero/seti2.gif" align=middle>) instead of Seth.  Thus, the Egyptians recognized the moral awkwardness of putting the name of Osiris's murderer on his temple, but this did not discredit the <a href="notes/oldking.htm#seth">cult of Seth</a> or the king named after him.  Some gods are just like that.  But they are still gods.<br clear="left">

<P><li><B>Example</B>:  The Greek hero of the <I>Iliad</I>, Achilles, seems to be a far less admirable character than the Trojan hero, Hector, whom Achilles slays at the climax of the epic.  Even the king of the gods, Zeus, is unhappy that the better man will lose, but it is the fate of Hector to die.  Later, Roman readers of the <I>Iliad</I> did not hesitate to imagine themselves descendants of the Trojans -- as in Virgil's <I>Aeneid</I>, where the Prince Aeneas, saved from Troy by his mother Aphrodite, travels to Italy and, anticipating Romulus, founds the Roman nation.  There is also a school of some note in Southern California, the arch-rival of the <a href="http://www.ucla.edu/">University of California at Los Angeles</a>, where the student body is named after the warriors of Troy.  They say that history is written by the winners, who will flatter themselves; but the <I>Iliad</I> shows that even so, the winners are not always admirable in mythic accounts.  Myth thus seems more true to life, as we also see in the moral complexity of the <a href="gita.htm#bharat"><I>Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata</I></a>.

<P><li><B>Changed in Philosophy</B>:  The Presocratic philosopher <a href="impiety.htm">Xenophanes</a> criticizes the poets for ascribing shameful acts to the gods:

<P><blockquote><img src="images/greek/xenoph-g.gif">

<P>Homer and Hesiod have attributed to the gods everything that is a shame and reproach among men, stealing and committing adultery and deceiving each other. [from Sextus Empiricus, <I>Against the Mathematicians</I>, translated by Kirk & Raven, <I>The Presocratic Philosophers</I>, Cambridge, 1964, p. 168]</blockquote>

<P>Heraclitus condemns blood sacrifice and the worship of idols.  The moralization of the Greek gods is thoroughly effected by Socrates and Plato, who cannot imagine the gods doing anything wrong or evil.  A similar moral critique is carried out in contemporary <a href="#text-3">Persian religion</a> by the prophet Zoroaster (<B>Zara<img src="images/greek/theta.gif">u<img src="images/greek/sh.gif">tra</B>); and Judaism, over a period of time, undergoes a similar process, as the Prophets represent God requiring just and holy actions.  Some Classicists, perhaps influenced by <a href="nietzsch.htm">Nietzsche</a>, don't like this process, as we see in the smear of Socrates in "<a href="impiety.htm">The Impiety of Socrates</a>."

</ul>
</ol>

<P>Given these characteristics, we can say that the <I>Instruction of Ptah.h.otep</I>, and similar items of Egyptian literature, display no break with mythpoeic modes of thought.  Indeed, if <I>Ptah.h.otep</I> were to count as philosophy, it is hard to see why parts of the Bible would not also count.  But the Bible is never proposed as the first example of Jewish philosophy, probably because this would confuse the distinction people would want to make between religion and philosophy.  On the other hand, works like the <a href="upan.htm#manduk"><I>M&acirc;n.d.&ucirc;kya Upanis.ad</I></a> and the <a href="taote.htm"><I>Tao Te Ching</I></a> are clearly impersonal, systematic, and innovative; and, although they are arguably religious, they are so in a way that is not recognizably analogous to Judaism, Christianity, and Isl&acirc;m, since a personal God does not appear in them.  Indeed, they are impersonal to a higher degree than much of Greek philosophy.  On the other hand, they are <I>aphoristic</I> (like <a href="wittgen.htm">Wittgenstein</a>) rather than argumentative, so they have not reached quite the same point as Parmenides in breaking with the fourth characteristic of mythic thought.

<P>A related problem to the identity of the sun is where it goes at night.  Ancient cosmology, of course, universally saw the earth as flat, extending down indefinitely, and the sky as a solid structure (a "firmament") overhead.  This gives rise to a case within a case of a multiplicity of expalanations, since the Egyptians had two different answers (if not more) for where the sun goes at night.  Since Atum sails in a boat, <img src="images/hiero/skyboat2.gif" align=middle>, one answer is that he goes down into the Underworld at sunset, sails through twelve caverns under the earth (one for each hour of the night), killing demons along the way, and then rises into the sky again at dawn.

<P><img src="images/hiero/sky.gif" align=right>A stranger explanation involves the goddess of the sky, <B>Nut</B>.  As in the image at right, she stretches across the sky from West to East, held up by her son, the god of the air, <B>Shu</B>.  At sunset, she <B>eats</B> the sungod, boat and all.  He passes through her body during the night, and she gives birth to him at dawn.

<P>Some images of Nut, as on the burial chamber of the tomb of <a href="notes/newking.htm#nut">Ramesses VI</a>, show small red images of the sun within Nut's body, one for each hour of the night.  This tomb also answers a question we might have.  Did the Egyptians tend to believe one or the other of these explanations?  No, for both are represented in the same tomb.  The subterranean halls of the tomb itself represent the journey through the Underworld, which is described by texts on the walls.  So the Egyptians had no difficulty, in this case as in others, believing different, logically exclusive explanations of the same thing.

<P>The need for an explanation of where the sun goes at night disappears with <B>Anaximander of Miletus</B> (c.550 BC), who first conceived of the earth as a <a href="hist-1.htm#anaximander"><I>finite body floating in space</I></a>.  There is "sky" below the earth as well as above it -- a notion that would have struck most ancient people as very bizarre.  With that leap of imagination, however, we then conceive of the sun as simply remaining in the sky.  It doesn't need to do anything else.<br clear=right>

<P><img src="images/hiero/skyboat.gif" align=right>In the solar barque we see at right, the sungod has the head of a ram, which is borrowed from the god <B>Amon</B>, the wind god of Thebes who became politically important with the Theban dynasties <a href="notes/midking.htm#12">XII</a> and <a href="notes/newking.htm#18">XVIII</a>.  As such, he is often called "Amon-R&ecirc;," a form of the god increasingly seen from the XVIII Dynasty onward.<br clear=right>

<P>Another interesting version of the sun god is the "Two-lion-god," <I>Rwty</I>, <img src="images/hiero/rwty.gif" align=middle>.  This is a solar god, who can be portrayed as a human body with a lion's head, but more characeristically as <I>two</I> lions that face away from a solar disk or from the hieroglyph for "horizon," which is a solar disk between two mountains (as seen in the image above).  Indeed, <I>'<U>kh</U>ty</I>, <img src="images/hiero/akhti.gif" align=middle>, "belonging to the horizon," which is abbreviated as the two horizontal ("of the horizon"!) lines in the name of R&ecirc;-Horakht&icirc; (<img src="images/hiero/horakht2.gif" align=middle>), shows this hieroglyph twice.  This may represent the Eastern and Western horizons, as the two lions apparently do also, facing sunrise and sunset.  It is a curious god, however, who is manifest in two beings.  This is a multiplicity, not just of explanations, but of a single divine being.

<P><blockquote><font size=+1>In Greece it was of course chiefly the Spartans, the people who resisted the commercial revolution most strongly, who did not recognize individual property but allowed and even encouraged theft.  To our time they have remained the prototype of savages who rejected civilization...  Yet already in Plato and Aristotle, however, we find a nostalgic longing for return to Spartan practice, and this longing persists to the present.  It is a craving for a micro-order determined by the overview of omniscient authority.</font>

<P><a name="text-000">If Greek philosophy was different from what came before, as <A HREF="#">previously</A> considered, the next question would be, "Why the Greeks?"  What was different about the Greeks that led to the origin of philosophy with them?  Years ago, the simple answer might have been that the Greeks were "different," they just had some kind of special "genius" that enabled them to think about things in new and different ways.  That kind of answer is unsatisfactory, not only because it doesn't really explain anything, not only because it sounds disturbingly like some kind of <a href="racism.htm">racism</a> (the Greeks just must have been genetically different), but because it cannot then in turn explain why philosophy only occurred among <B>some</B> Greeks (e.g. Milesians, Athenians, etc.) and not among others (e.g. Spartans) [<a href="#note-000">note</a>].

<P>An explanation that is actually going to explain something about the origin of Greek philosophy must identify something that was different about what was happening to, or what was being done by, the <B>particular</B> Greeks who were responsible for that origin.  Such an explanation may suggest, but cannot be, a kind of Marxist economic determinism argument, since it is unlikely that everything <B>can</B> be explained by social or economic circumstances.  There is certainly a random factor in nature and in human affairs, and the possibility for a lone individual genius to make a difference cannot be dismissed.  On the other hand, there are also certainly <B>regularities</B>, and the association of certain kinds of activities with each other.  If something unique about Greek cities like Miletus and Athens can be identified, that may reveal unique regularities associated with Greek philosophy.

<P>As it happens, there was something conspicuously different about the culture, the society, and the livelihood of Greek cities like Miletus and Athens in comparison to the dominant forms in traditional Middle Eastern civilizations, like Egypt and Babylonia, and in other Greeks cities, like <a href="#sparta">Sparta</a>, that were never venues of Greek philosophy.  For one thing, those Greeks cities were wealthy, like Egypt and Babylon (and unlike Sparta), but they could not have been wealthy in the same way that Egypt and Babylon were wealthy.  The strength of the ancient states rested mainly on agriculture.  The Bible does not speak of the "flesh pots" of Egypt, "when we did eat bread to the full" (Exodus 16:3), for nothing.

<P>As in most traditional cultures, over 90% of Egyptians would have lived on the land and engaged in basic agricultural labor (85% of people in Tanzania, after decades of socialist government, still do).  In Egypt, with the annual flood of the Nile and the uniform warmth, large and reliable harvests were the norm, as in other areas farmers might apprehensively await the rain, endure frosts, etc.  <a name="text-1">Greek</a> cities were not going</a> to be wealthy in the same way, since Greece could not possibly be as agriculturally productive as Egypt or Mesopotamia.  <img src="images/maps/clime-md.gif" align=left>For one thing there was the climate.  The average annual rainfall in Athens is only 15.9 inches, not much more than in Los Angeles.  Indeed, like much of <a href="ross/calif.htm">California</a>, Greece has a <B>"Mediterranean"</B> climate:  <B>hot dry summers, and cool rainy winters</B> [<a href="#note-1">note</a>].  Some areas get considerably more rain than Athens, but that is because of local mountains, which gets us to the next problem:  the land itself.  Greece is very mountainous.  This does not make for good agriculture either.  Some areas contain famous plains, e.g. Arcadia, Thessaly; but the agricultural value of the plains is then compromised by the weather.  Some years, Thessaly gets less than 2 inches of rain.  <img src="images/maps/clime-na.gif" align=right>Large parts of California are agriculturally productive despite the climate because of water from nearby (the Sierra Nevada) or distant (the Rocky) mountains; but there are few rivers in Greece, and most of the country is broken up into islands and peninsulas that cannot receive the runoff of wetter mountains, however near or far.

<P>Cities like Miletus and Athens were thus wealthy off of something else:  <B>Trade</B>.  To engage in trade, all anyone needed was enough to get started, and Greek agriculture could provide a couple of starter products.  Olive trees are hardy and drought resistant and grow well enough in either Greece or California (they are conspicuous right in the center of <a href="./valley/">Los Angeles Valley College</a>).  Olives themselves must be soaked in brine to be edible, but more importantly they can be pressed to obtain olive oil.  The oil is not very perishable, and so could be stored and shipped (in the up to six foot tall jars that the Greeks made) quite easily, to be sold at distant locations for food, fuel oil, hair grooming, or other purposes.  Similarly, the Greek climate (like California, again) is good for growing grapes.  Grapes can be pressed and fermented to produce wine, another product that is not very perishable and can be similarly stored and shipped.  Even apart from any other products, these would get a city like Miletus started in the exchange of products all over the Mediterranean.

<P><a name="text-2a">We might think that trade as a way of life already</a> could explain much.  It would involve and foster considerable independence, being far away from all authority at home [<a href="#note-2">note</a>], and it would involve dealing with all sorts of novel peoples, cultures, practices, and ideas.  If we look for a way of life to get people thinking, that might be it.  How this contrasts with ordinary life back in Egypt is explained for us by the Egyptians themselves:  A favorite text for scribal students to copy in Ancient Egypt recounted how much better the life of a scribe was to all other ways of life.  This was the so-called "Satire of the Trades," and it actually begins,

<P><blockquote><a name="text-3a">I have seen many beatings</a> -- <br>
Set your heart on books!<br>
I watched those seized for labor -- <br>
There's nothing better than books! [<a href="#note-3">note</a>]</blockquote>

<P>Here the "beatings," besides the ordinary encouragement of overseers, <img src="images/hiero/a24.gif" align=middle>, to which scribes might not always be witness, can easily refer to the business of collecting taxes in Egypt. Every year, when the Nile flooded, the height of the river was read off the wall of a stairway, later called the "Nilometer," cut down into the granite of Elephantine Island, <img src="images/hiero/elephant.gif" align=middle>, at Aswan, <img src="images/greek/aswan.gif" align=middle>, at the natural southern boundary of Ancient Egypt.

<tr><th>Elephantine Island at Aswan; the form of the rock may have suggested the body of an elephant; <a href="./ross/ross-7.htm">1969</a></th></tr>
</table>

The height of the river then could be converted into the <B>area</B> of the country covered by the flood that year, and the area could be converted into the estimated yield of virtually every bit of farmland.  Thus, at the harvest, the tax collectors showed up to seize, since there was no money, the State's share of the harvest.  Peasants who, for one reason or another, did not have the crop to deliver, would simply be knocked down and beaten, with the tax collectors' attendant scribes calmly observing and recording the transaction.

<P><a name="mason">Similarly, the reference of the text to "those seized for labor" is probably to the ancient system of the <B>corv&eacute;e</B>, <img src="images/hiero/corvee.gif" align=middle>, by which local peasants could be pressed into labor for public works projects, like the pyramids, especially during the season of the <a href="notes/midking.htm#calendar">Flood</a>, when work in the fields would have been impossible anyway.  The building of new cities and palaces in the Delta initiated by <a href="notes/newking.htm#19">Ramesses II</a> (c. 1290-1224), depended on drafts of the local population, many of whom were not ethnic Egyptians, for labor.  This is remembered in the Bible, of course, as "slavery," from which the <a href="notes/newking.htm#israel">Israelites</a> fled back into Asia.  The miseries of brickmaking do not seem to be remembered there with fondness.  Indeed, the scribes give us the picture:

<P><blockquote>I'll describe to you also the mason:<br>
His loins give him pain;<br>
Though he is out in the wind,<br>
He works without a cloak;<br>
His loincloth is a twisted rope<br>
And a string in the rear.<br>
His arms are spent from exertion,<br>
Having mixed all kinds of dirt;<br>
When he eats bread [with] his fingers,<br>
[He has washed at the same time]. [p. 187]<br></blockquote>

<P>The idea in the last lines seems to be that the "mason" (now obviously not a stone mason), having been mixing dirt all day, cannot eat without the dirt worked into his fingers getting into his bread.  The work is probably performed naked but for a rope thong because no one would want to expose good cloth to the mud in which the workers inevitably stand and stoop.  Of another professional concerned with earth, the potter, the scribes say, "He grubs in the mud more than a pig" [p. 186].  While the peasant, well, "A peasant is not called a man" [p. 190].  The life of a <I>merchant</I> or <I>trader</I>, on the other hand, is not even mentioned.

<P>If delivery from such labor in Ancient Egypt meant becoming a scribe, it is now hard to imagine the life of a <a href="bureau.htm">bureaucrat</a> fostering very much more in the way of independence of mind or creativity.  Indeed, nothing was valued more highly in Egypt than <B>conformity</B>, which is no less than what we would expect.

<P><a name="text-4">However stark the contrast of this with</a> a life of travel, business, discovery, and independence, trade alone will not explain the uniqueness of the Greek situation, for the Greeks were neither alone nor the first in their commercial profession.

They had learned the basics, and much else (including their <a href="archon.htm#pronounce">alphabet</a>), from some of the most ancient traders:  the <B>Phoenicians</B> [<a href="#note-4">note</a>].

<P><a name="text-5a">Ancient Phoenicia was rather smaller than the modern <a href="turkia.htm#lebanon">Lebanon</a>; it was just <B>Mount Lebanon</B>, whose steep slopes often come right down to the Mediterranean, as we see at left.  This put the Phoenicians in much the same situation economically as the Greeks.  Rainfall was certainly less of a problem, but the Mountain [<a href="#note-5">note</a>], very steep and rocky, was otherwise most unsuited for agriculture.

<P>But, like the Greeks, the Phoenicians also had available a couple of basic local products to get started in trade.  Mount Lebanon, although difficult for agriculture, was nevertheless forested:  &nbsp;with the famous and evocative <B>Cedars of Lebanon</B>.  This was a valuable resource when the surrounding semi-arid and desert areas were short of trees.  Especially when the Egyptians began their great building projects, good lumber was essential.  <a name="text-6">One cannot imagine 100 ton granite obelisks, quarried at Aswan, being floated down the Nile in boats made of bundled reeds.

<P>Evidence of how early the Phoenicians were supplying wood to Egypt can still be

seen in the <B>Bent Pyramid of <a href="notes/oldking.htm#4">Seneferu</a></B> (c. 2610 BC) at Dahshur, where the dry climate has preserved cedar beams (shown at right) that were used to shore up the upper chamber against the cracking caused by errors in the construction and siting of the pyramid [<a href="#note-6">note</a>].

<P>Whole cedar boats have been found in pits next to the <a href="notes/oldking.htm#4">Great Pyramid</a>.  At first it was not believed that they were real boats, since the remains just looked like piles of lumber.  They were just "symbolic" boats.  It was also confusing that there were no nails.  The planks had actually been <I>tied</I> together with rope, and then caulked for waterproofing.  The reconstructed boats are impressive examples.  Nothing else like this survives from the 3rd Millennium BC; and known later boats are generally from shipwrecks, whose sinking makes recovery and reconstruction that much more difficult.  The <a href="germania.htm#norse">Viking</a> boats used in burials come the closest to the quality of the Egyptian ships.

<P><a name="purple">Another product the Phoenicians eventually traded in was a <B>purple dye</B> produced at Tyre from local marine snails, <I>Murex brandaris</I> and <I>Murex trunculus</I> (now gratuitously[?] renamed <I>Haustellum brandaris</I> and <I>Hexaplex trunculus</I>).  Quite the opposite of lumber in terms of bulk, "<B>Tyrian Purple</B>," <I>porph&yacute;ra</I>, <img src="images/greek/porphyra.gif" align=middle>, became the most famous product of Phoenicia; and it was so valuable that eventually a purple robe was taken as symbolic of the office of <a href="romania.htm">Roman Emperor</a>.  "Putting on the purple" came to mean <I>becoming</I> Roman Emperor.

<P>Depending on how it was processed -- it was only discovered in the 1980's that this could be accomplished merely with exposure to sunlight -- the dye could also be a <B>blue</B> color, which thus is likely the dye specified in the Bible for the blue on Jewish prayer shawls and other applications -- <img src="history/israel.gif" align=left>blue is still used, also on the flag of <a href="outremer.htm#israel">Israel</a>.  If so, this use would antedate the familiarity of the Greeks with the purple dye.  The <a href="hist-1.htm#john">Septuagint</a> translates "blue" from Hebrew as <B>hy&aacute;kinthos</B>, <img src="images/greek/blue.gif" align=middle>, i.e. "hyacinth" [cf. 2 Chronicles 3:14, for the veil of Solomon's Temple].  For the colors "purple" or "red" in Greek the word <B>pho&icirc;nix</B>, <img src="images/greek/pho-pur.gif" align=middle>, the word for "Phoenician," could be used.

<P>The most famous statement about "the Purple" is certainly that of the Empress <a href="romania.htm#nika"><font color="#ff00ff">Theodora</font></a>, who, rather than flee the Nika Revolt of 532, is supposed to have said, "the Purple makes the noblest shroud."  The Emperor Justinian, thus encouraged, or shamed, put down the revolt.  Unfortunately, like many other famous quotes in history, this is not quite right.  According to Procopius, Theodora said, "<B>Royalty</B> [<img src="images/greek/royalty.gif" align=middle>, <I>basile&iacute;a</I>] <a href="archon.htm#theodora"><img src="images/theodora.gif" align=right border=0></a>is a beautiful shroud" [<I>Procopius, History of the Wars, I</I>, Book I, xxiv 37-38, translated by H.B. Dewing, Loeb Classical Library, Harvard U. Press, 1914, 2001, p.232-233].  In the same speech however, she did say, "I will not be separated from this <B>Purple</B>" -- <I>halourg&iacute;s</I>, <img src="images/greek/halurgis.gif" align=middle>, specifically a purple robe [p.230-231].  The traditional misquotation thus deftly combines two actual quotations.  See "<a href="archon.htm#theodora">The Grammar of Theodora's Statement</a>."

<P>Both the Greeks and the Phoenicians, in the course of their trade, founded colonies all over the Mediterranean.  The map below illustrates this activity and its implied competition.  Greek colonies came to ring the Aegean and Black Seas, the southern coast of Italy, eastern Sicily, Cyrenaica in Libya, and in places on the coast of Gaul (modern France) and northeastern Spain.  The largest modern cities derived from Greek colonies are probably Marseille in France (<B>Massilia</B>), <a href="italia.htm#naples">Naples</a> in Italy (<B>Neapolis</B>, <img src="images/greek/neapolis.gif" align=middle>, the "New City" -- remembered in the name of "Neapolitan" icecream), and Istanbul (originally <B>Byzantion</B>, <img src="images/greek/byzantio.gif" align=middle>, later <B>Constantinopolis</B> -- <a href="decdenc1.htm#constantinople">Constantinople</a>).  Phoenician colonies coexisted with Greek cities in Cyprus and Sicily, but excluded Greeks on Sardinia and Corsica, in the south of Spain, and especially along North Africa.  Phoenician colonial power was particularly concentrated at Carthage -- <B>Qart H.adasht</B>, the "New City" (<img src="images/greek/qartnew.gif" align=middle> in the Hebrew equivalent, writing the "t" in the adjective that is latent in what is ordinarily written and pronounced as an "h" in Hebrew and Arabic), Greek <img src="images/greek/carthage.gif" align=middle>, <I>Karkh&ecirc;d&oacute;n</I>, Latin <I>Carthago</I> -- eventually seen by Rome as her greatest rival.  In the south of Spain Cadiz (<B>Gades</B>) was a Phoenician city.  The, by then, Carthaginian domain in Spain was much expanded by <B>Hamilcar Barca</B>, the father of the great Hannibal (247-183 BC), in the time between the <a href="hist-1.htm#carthage1">First</a> (264-241) and <a href="hist-1.htm#carthage2">Second</a> (218-201) Punic Wars with Rome.  In the course of that expansion, the city later known in Latin as <B>Carthago Nova</B>, "New Carthage" (Cartagena), was founded.

<P><center><IMG SRC="./images/maps/colonies.gif"></center>

<P>From Spain, the Phoenicians did something the Greeks did not -- venture out into the Atlantic.  They probably went as far as Britain (from which tin was obtained), and certainly went well down the coast of Africa -- how far is unclear, since the Phoenicians kept their doings as secret as possible.  One story repeated by the Greek historian Herodotus is that the Phoenicians sailed entirely around Africa on commission from King <a href="#26">Neko II</a> of Egypt.  The best evidence that this was accomplished (there is no other) is the very idea that it was possible:  later Greek and Roman geographers thought that Africa was connected to a Southern Continent and could not be circumnavigated.  Phoenician trading posts in Greece itself, reflected even in Greek mythology with stories like the foundation of Thebes by the Phoenician Cadmus, initiated Greek trading in the years after about 800 BC.

<P>But after all this, we may then ask, that if trade is to be associated with the origin of philosophy, why did not philosophy start with the Phoenicians?  After a fashion, perhaps it did.  The man credited with being the first Greek philosopher, <B>Thales of Miletus</B>, <img src="images/greek/thales.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/the-mas.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/milesian.gif" align=middle> (<I>c.</I>585 BC), was said to have been of Phoenician ancestry.  However, he was living in a Greek city; and even later philosophers who were certainly ethnic Phoenicians, like <a href="hist-1.htm#hellen">Zeno of Citium</a>, moved to Greek cities to learn and practice philosophy.

<P><a name="text-7">The clue to what happened in the Greek cities</a> may be found in something else that seems to be a unique characteristic of Greek history:  By the time we know much about events, traditional kings in Greeks cities are mostly gone.  This had never happened before.  When ancient kings were overthrown, which happened often enough, they were simply replaced by other kings.  The Phoenician cities all had traditional kings.  But in Greece, the <B>institution</B> of kingship lost its traction.  At Athens, the office of <a href="archon.htm"><B><I>&aacute;rch&ocirc;n</I></B></a>, <img src="images/greek/archon.gif" align=middle>, "ruler" or "regent," pushed aside the authority of the king (who eventually became another elected <I>&aacute;rch&ocirc;n</I>).  It was filled at first by hereditary nobles, then by elected nobles with life tenure, then by elected nobles with ten year tenure (starting in 753), then with elected nobles by annual tenure (starting in 683), and then with the office opened (by Solon, c. 593) to qualification by wealth, rather than by noble birth.  After some conflict and the rule of tyrants (especially Pisitratus), overthrown in 510, <B>Cleisthenes</B> led Athens into essentially pure democracy [<a href="#note-7">note</a>].

<P><a name="text-8">Unlike the Phoenician cities, which had been engaged</a> in commerce for centuries, and where the kings were merchants themselves, the creation of wealth by trade in the Greeks cities seems to have undermined traditional authority.  Whoever jumped into the game first would become, perhaps for the first time in history, a <B><I>nouveau riches</I></B> class that chaffed at hereditary privilege and had the means, by bribery and hire, to marshal forces against it.  Since wealth by trade could be made away from home, it would be entirely outside the control of a hometown ruler.  Returning home with a new sense of power and independence [<a href="#note-8">note</a>], a merchant could well have lost much of his awe and respect for authority by birth.  Seeing Greece of the Dark Ages (c. 1200-800 BC) as the kind of feudal society pictured in the <I>Iliad</I>, it not hard to imagine the new world of merchants and commerce with the same kind of dynamic that the Italian trading cities of the Renaissance exhibited in starting the process that undermined European Mediaeval aristocracy.

<P><a name=text-16>Also, we can say that for the first time in history these transformations could have been accomplished by <a href="money.htm#socrates"><B>money</B></a>:  &nbsp;Money, meaning coined precious metals, was invented soon after 640 in the Kingdom of Lydia.  The Lydians were not Greeks, but the Lydian kings, after the Phoenician manner, were businessmen; and they worked closely with the adjacent Greek cities of Ionia.  Money thus facilitated the rise of a city like Thales's Miletus; and since coinage enhances the manner in which wealth can be concentrated and transferred, we can also imagine that it enhanced the process of social mobility and political conflict [<a href="#note-16">note</a>].

<P><a name="text-9">What happened in Greek cities politically and socially was extraordinary enough, but it is also our clue about the origin of philosophy.  <img src="images/maps/ionia.gif" align=right>Although we can only imagine the nature of the causal connection, the <B>correlation</B> between philosophy and the cities of commercial wealth and political transformation is obvious.  Greek philosophy began in <img src="images/greek/ionia.gif" align=middle>, <B>Ionia</B> (today on the west coast of Turkey), in the wealthiest and most active cities of their time in Greece.  For some years Greek philosophy then seemed to circulate around the Greek colonial periphery, from Ionia (Thales, Anaximander, Anaximines, Heralcitus, Xenophanes), to Italy (Pythagoras, Parmenides, Zeno), Sicily (Empedocles), and the northern Aegean (Democritus, Protagoras), to Ionia again (Melissos).  Then philosophy migrated from every direction to <B>Athens</B> itself, at the center, the wealthiest commercial power and the most famous democracy of the time [<a href="#note-9">note</a>].  <B>Socrates</B>, although uninterested in wealth himself, nevertheless was a creature of the marketplace, where there were always people to meet and where he could, in effect, bargain over definitions rather than over prices.  Similarly, although Socrates avoided participation in democratic politics, it is hard to imagine his idiosyncratic individualism, and the uncompromising self-assertion of his defense speech, without either wealth or birth to justify his privileges, occurring in any other political context.

<P>If a <I>commercial democracy</I> like Athens provided the social and intellectual context that fostered the development of philosophy, we might expect that philosophy would <B>not</B> occur in the kind of Greek city that was neither commercial nor democratic.  As it happens, the great rival of Athens, <B>Sparta</B>, was just such a city.  Sparta had a peculiar, oligarchic constitution, with two kings and a small number of enfranchised citizens.  Most of the subjects of the Spartan state had little or no political power, and many of them were <B><I>helots</I></B>, who were essentially held as slaves and could be killed by a Spartan citizen at any time for any reason -- annual war was formally declared on the <I>helots</I> for just that purpose.  The whole business of the Spartan citizenry was war.  Unlike Athens, Sparta had no nearby seaport.  It was not engaged in or interested in commerce.  It had no resident alien population like Athens -- there was no reason for foreigners of any sort to come to Sparta.  Spartan citizens were allowed to possess little money, and Spartan men were expected, officially, to eat all their meals at a common mess, where the food was legendarily bad -- all to toughen them up.  Spartans had so little to say that the term "Laconic," from <I>Laconia</I>, the environs of Sparta, is still used to mean "of few words" -- as "Spartan" itself is still used to mean simple and ascetic.

<P>While this gave Sparta the best army in Greece, regarded by all as next to invincible, and helped Sparta defeat Athens in the Peloponnesian War (431-404), we do not find at Sparta any of the accoutrements otherwise normally associated with Classical Greek civilization:  no historians, no playwrights, no great architecture, and, especially, no philosophers.  Socrates would have found few takers for his conversation at Sparta -- and it is hard to imagine the city tolerating his questions for anything like the thirty or more years that Athens did.  Next to nothing remains at the site of Sparta to attract tourists (the nearby Mediaeval complex at <a href="romania.htm#mistra">Mistra</a> is of much greater interest), while Athens is one of the major tourist destinations of the world.  Indeed, we basically wouldn't even <B>know</B> about Sparta were it not for the historians (e.g. Thucydides) and philosophers (e.g. Plato and Aristotle) at Athens who write about her.  In the end, philosophy made the fortune of Athens, which essentially became the University Town of the Roman Empire (only Alexandria came close as a center of learning); but even Sparta's army eventually failed her, as Spartan hegemony was destroyed at the battle of Leuctra in 371 by the brilliant Theban general <B>Epaminondas</B>, <img src="images/greek/epaminon.gif" align=middle>, who killed a <a href="#sparta">Spartan</a> king, Cleombrotus, for the first time since King Leonidas was killed by the Persians at Thermopylae in 480.

<P>A story about <B>Thales</B> throws a curious light on the polarization between commercial culture and its opposition.  It was said that Thales was not a practical person, sometimes didn't watch where he was walking, fell into a well (according to Plato), was laughed at, and in general was reproached for not taking money seriously like everyone else.  Finally, he was sufficiently irked by the derision and criticisms that he decided to teach everyone a lesson.  By studying the stars (according to Aristotle), he determined that there was to be an exceptionally large olive harvest that year.  Borrowing some money, he secured all the olive presses (used to get the oil, of course) in Miletus, and when the harvest came in, he took advantage of his monopoly to charge everyone dearly.  After making this big financial killing, Thales announced that he could do this anytime and so, if he otherwise didn't do so and seemed impractical, it was because he simply did not value the money in the first place.

<P><a name="text-10">This story curiously contains internal evidence</a> of its own falsehood.  One cannot determine the nature of the harvest by studying the stars; otherwise astrologers would make their fortunes on the commodities markets, not by selling their analyses to the public [<a href="#note-10">note</a>].  So if Thales did not monopolize the olive presses with the help of astrology, and is unlikely to have done what this story relates, we might ask if he was the kind of impractical person portrayed in the story in the first place.  It would <B>not</B> seem so from all the other accounts we have about him.  The tendency of this evidence goes in two directions:

<ul><li>First, Thales seems to engage in activities that would be consistent with any other Milesian engaged in business.  The story about him going to Egypt, although later assimilated to fabulous stories about Greeks learning the mysteries of the Egyptians (who don't seem to have had any such mysteries, and would not have been teaching them to Greeks anyway), is perfectly conformable to what many Greeks actually <B>were</B> doing in Egypt, i.e. engaging in trade or working for the King of Egypt as mercenary soldiers.  Indeed, the Greeks had another basic export besides olive oil and wine, and that was <I>warriors</I>.  Since the Greek cities fought among themselves all the time, the occasional peace left many of them seeking to continue the wars by other means.  The Egyptian kings of the <a href="#26">XXVI Dynasty</a> found plenty for them to do there.  Indeed, the kings relied so heavily on Greek mercenaries, and there were so many Greek traders swarming over Egypt, that considerable tensions arose.  The Egyptians basically didn't like foreigners, and the Greeks, although awed by Egypt, also found the Egyptians more than a little strange and ridiculous.  Their references to things Egyptian were sometimes mocking:  "Pyramid" (<img src="images/greek/pyramid.gif" align=middle>, <I>pyram&iacute;s</I>) may be from <img src="images/greek/pyramous.gif" align=middle>, <I>pyramo&ucirc;s</I>, a wheat and honey cake; and "obelisk" (<img src="images/greek/obelisk.gif" align=middle>, <I>obel&iacute;skos</I>) means a "little spit."

<P><center><a href="tombs.htm#elements"><img src="images/maps/egypt-27.gif" border=0></a></center>

<P>King Ah.mose II, <img src="images/hiero/ahmose.gif" align=middle> (570-526) defused the tensions by directing that Greek trading activities be concentrated at <B>Naucratis</B>, <img src="images/greek/naucrati.gif" align=middle>, which was then founded as a Greek colony, not far from the Egyptian capital of Sais, <img src="images/greek/sais.gif" align=middle>.  This worked well.  As a colony, Naucratis was a little unusual, existing under the sovereignty of Egypt, and also because several Greek cities joined in the founding.  Usually a colony had one "mother city" (<img src="images/greek/metropol.gif" align=middle>, <I>metr&oacute;polis</I>), from which a charter and colonists were derived.  As it happened, Miletus was one of the founders of Naucratis.  <a name="text-11">The degree of involvement with</a> Miletus in Egypt thus makes it more than probable that Thales, engaged in the ordinary business of his fellow citizens, would have found himself there, probably more than once.  This is then consistent with the story of Thales discovering how to measure the height of the pyramids [<a href="#note-11">note</a>] -- and also with the story of Thales learning navigational techniques from the Phoenicians.  Since the Phoenicians were secretive about their affairs, especially to rivals, this reinforces the report, mentioned already, that Thales was of Phoenician derivation.

<P><li>The second insight into Thales's activities comes from the account of his work for <a href="#lydia">King Alyattes of Lydia</a>.  A dreamer who goes around falling into wells does not sound like someone to hire for military engineering projects; but that is the account (from Herodotus) that we have of Thales, who is supposed to have actually diverted a river around behind the Lydian army so that it could avoid too deep a ford.  The war between the Medes and the Lydians, during which Thales accompanied the Lydian king, also provides us with the one solid date that we have for Thales's life.  That is because the climactic battle between the Medes and Lydians, at which Thales would have been present, was stopped by a total eclipse of the sun.  The date of the eclipse can now be calculated precisely:  28 May 585 BC.  The path of the eclipse can even be inspected using computer software on home computers.  The eclipse, indeed, was later said to have been predicted by Thales.  That is clearly impossible.  To predict an eclipse, one must know <B>what an eclipse is</B> -- the moon getting in the way of the sun -- and no Greek knew that for some time to come; and one must have records of eclipses for some centuries to understand the relationship of the moon's orbit to the ecliptic (the apparent path of the sun in the sky) -- the Greeks had no such records perhaps until the Pythagoreans.

<P><a name="text-12">Although Thales could not have</a> predicted the eclipse, it <B>could</B> have been predicted at the time -- by the Babylonians.  We know that the Babylonians had the understanding and the records, not just because the priest <a href="hist-1.htm#manetho">B&ecirc;r&ocirc;ssos</a> transferred records back to 747 BC into his treatise on astronomy (in the Hellenistic Period), but because original astronomical and mathematical records and treatises survive, especially from the libraries of the Kings of Assyria [<a href="#note-12">note</a>].  Consequently, if the story about Thales was not made up out of whole cloth, the only explanation is that he <B>heard</B>, perhaps on his travels, that there was going to be an eclipse.  The Babylonian priests were in the habit of publicly announcing astronomical events, as the priests in Jerusalem also announced things like the beginning of the month and occurrence of Passover; but, in the absence of newspapers, radio, wire services, CNN, etc., these announcements may only have travelled by word of mouth.  If Thales heard of the prediction, and then reported it back home, it may not have been remembered that he merely reported, rather than originated, the story.
</ul>

<P>The overall impression of Thales then is more of a man of affairs, sometimes very serious affairs (e.g. war), and not of an abstracted, impractical dreamer who disdains money and doesn't watch where he's walking.  But if that was the case, why would the story about Thales and the olive presses have been told in the first place?  Because, indeed, such disdain for money <B>would be</B> characteristic of later Greek philosophy.  Where Socrates was simply unconcerned with the ordinary commercial life of Athens, while he flourished right in the middle of it, philosophers like Plato and Aristotle had become actively hostile to it and removed their own activities to closed schools outside the walls of Athens.  Only one great school of philosophy, <a href="hist-1.htm#text-1"><B>Stoicism</B></a>, remained in the marketplace, taking its name from the characteristic open-faced building, often called a "porch," a <img src="images/greek/stoa.gif" align=middle>, <B><I>stoa</I></B>, that was to be found there, and in one of which Zeno of Citium established himself.  Plato distrusted commerce, detested democracy, and also came to believe that teaching philosophy to just anyone was dangerous.  A tradition of ethical argument arose that questioned whether engaging in trade was even moral, since merchants did not produce their commodities and so did not contribute to their intrinsic value.  Some philosophers, indeed, perceived that the value of products also depended on their <B>location</B>, so that trade was useful in moving things to where they were needed or wanted; but then someone like Plato was also distrustful of that service, since a lot of superfluous trade goods could engender <B>"unnecessary desires"</B> and distract people from their duties and more sober pursuits.  But as late as the 5th century, <a href="hist-1.htm#late"><B>St. Augustine</B></a> was still advising that trade was not a profession that could be practiced without moral harm.

<P>Comparing Athens and Sparta, a philosopher like Plato was unmistakably a Spartan sympathizer.  Yet even he realized there was a problem:  the Spartans not only were uninterested in thought and speech, but they were violent and brutal.  Plato realized that philosophy had no place there, and he was concerned lest the rulers in his ideal <a href="plato.htm"><I>Republic</I></a> exhibit those characteristics.  So Plato never tried to sell his thought at Sparta.  He did entertain a hope, however, that if a tyrant could be "converted" to philosophy, then his ideas would be implemented.  One of his efforts to do so involved the tyrant Dionysius II of <a href="archon.htm#syracuse">Syracuse</a> (367-357 & 346-344).  During one trip there, however, in 361, Plato so infuriated Dionysius, evidently, that he was sold into slavery and had to be redeemed by his friends and family.  Naturally, he gave up on tyrants after that experience.  So, although Plato had no love for the democracy at Athens, he "voted with his feet," as they say, in its favor.

<P>The attitudes in Greek philosophy towards Athens and Sparta, as well as sympathies and actions comparable to those of Plato, can also be seen in the Twentieth Century.  <B>Henry Kissinger</B>, President Nixon's foreign policy adviser and later Secretary of State, is supposed to have remarked once, privately, that the <B>United States</B> was liable to lose the Cold War to the <B>Soviet Union</B> in the same way and for the same reasons that <B>Athens</B> lost the Peloponnesian War to <B>Sparta</B>.  <a name="text-13">While America, presumably, was enervated by</a> the political squabbling characteristic of democracy and by the crass materialism of capitalistic consumerism, the Soviet Union was lean, disciplined (i.e. Spartan), morally upright (no pornography or gay rights demonstrations there), unified, and remorselessly purposful [<a href="#note-13">note</a>].  At the same time, it was not uncommon in the United States for leftist academics and intellectuals to harbor much admiration for the Soviet Union, or later for Communist China, Cuba, Vietnam, or Nicaragua, despite widespread knowledge of the police state apparatus of those regimes, of the mass murders, slave labor camps, torture, brainwashing, false confessions, etc. -- Josef Stalin can be credited with as many as 50 million civilian deaths, as opposed to "only" 20 million for Adolf Hitler.  Nevertheless, like Plato, most sympathizers voted with their feet to stay in the United States [<a href="#note-14">note</a>].

<P>Despite the Fall of Communism, much disdain for commercial democracy remains.  As Greek philosophy <B>never</B> came to appreciate the social, political, and economic context in which it originated, grew, and thrived, many modern intellectuals continue to despise the very kind of society in which they are uniquely to be found -- <I>uniquely</I> in great measure because the kind of society they evidently want would actually not allow them to express their own opinions, or to subsidize such expression so lavishly, either at state expense (e.g. at state universities) or by guilty philanthropists (e.g. Ted Turner).  So, although the Soviet Union is gone, like Sparta, and its vast experiment in common ownership and economic planning failed utterly, as well as being drenched in the blood of its victims, one would hardly know this listening to contemporary leftists and Marxists.  The planning of a command economy still sounds like the wave of the future to them.

<P>Ironically, Marx himself may provide the best key to this phenomenon:  &nbsp;Intellectuals may like the idea of command and control for a society and for an economy because they see <I>themselves</I> in control.  Not surprisingly, Plato thinks that the problem of politics is that the <B>wrong people are in charge</B>, and the rulers in his ideal <I>Republic</I> are <B>people like him</B>.  Intellectuals have a "class interest" (which means a <B>self-interest</B> -- for people who otherwise say they detest "self-interest") in promoting this idea.  They see their own lofty achievements as entitling them to the rule of others -- a self-interest now described by the theory of <a href="rent.htm">rent-seeking</a>.  In this way, the crypto-socialist economist John Kenneth Galbraith (1908-2006) fulminated against <I>advertising</I> as producing, just as Plato would have said, "unnecessary desires."  And, since people can be so easily manipulated by advertising into buying things that they don't need or that are bad for them, we clearly need people <I>like him</I> in charge to protect us.  This kind of arrogance will soon probably produce the prohibition of tobacco, as it disastrously produced Prohibition of alcohol in the 20's.

<P>But one of the clearest lessons of the Twentieth Century is that this self-serving fantasy of rule by Academia is the most bitter folly:  &nbsp;Absolute power, once unleashed, slips from the hands of timid professors and is seized by ruthless monsters like Lenin, Hitler, Stalin, Castro, etc.  &nbsp;The intellectuals get silenced, killed, or, almost worse, become fawning mouthpieces for tyranny.  Too many intellectuals were already mouthpieces for tyranny, even when they didn't need to be, as when the <I>New York Times</I> reporter, Walter Duranty, received a Pulitzer Prize for his reporting on Stalinist Russia, even while he was helping to suppress the truth about Stalin's terror famine in the Ukraine -- the starving to death of millions of peasants (perhaps 5 million) just because they had been too successful on their private farms.  Success made them class enemies, "Kulaks."

<P>Thus, the question of the origin of Greek philosophy, to which Athens itself, with its commercial democracy, is the answer, remains relevant to the politics of the Twentieth and, evidently, the Twenty-First Centuries.  Indeed, it is a distressing and sobering new truth of history, little suspected before our time, that a vast educated class may, by its very nature, be hostile to freedom, democracy, and the creation of wealth for everyone -- though China was similarly ill served by the scholar <a href="six.htm#text-2">Mandarins</a>.  The truth is not enough.  As <B>Thomas Jefferson</B> said, "All know the influence of interest on the mind of man, and how unconsciously his judgment is warped by that influence."  Indeed, what we find today is that many academics deny there is truth, revel in the irrationality and incoherence of their own assertions, and nakedly assert that power is the end of all discourse.  It should be no surprise to then see the <I>educated</I> promoting <I>ignorance</I> and the <I>free</I> promoting <I>tyranny</I>, all in the hope that power will fall to <I><B>them</B></I>.  They will, indeed, derive no benefit should their ambitions be realized, but by then it will be too late for benefit to anyone else.

<P><blockquote><center><img src="images/greek/nicephor.gif"><br>
<font size=+1>Vos non Romani, sed Longobardi estis!<br>
You are not Romans, but Lombards!</font></center>

<P>The Emperor <a href="romania.htm#john">Nicephorus II Phocas</a> to <a href="decdenc1.htm#note-9">Liutprand of Cremona</a> (c.920-972), who represents the "Roman" Emperor <a href="francia.htm#saxon">Otto I</a>, 968 AD; "Embassy," XII, <I>The Complete Works of Liudprand of Cremona</I>, translated by Paolo Squatriti [The Catholic Press of America, 2007, p.246]; Latin text, "Liudprandi Legatio," <I>Die Werke Liudprands von Cremona</I>, herausgeben von Joseph Becker [<I>Scriptores Rerum Germanicarum</I>, Hahnsche Buchhandlung, Hannover und Leipzig, 1915, p.182; Reprint, University of Michigan Libraries, 2012].  While Liutprand wrote in Latin; this is not what Nicephorus spoke, and the Greek version here is a speculative back-translation from Latin to Greek.

<P>Liutprand, of course, was himself the Lombard, not the Saxon Otto; and Nicephorus was also infuriated that Liutprand carried a letter, not only presenting Otto as a "Roman," but that addressed Nicephorus himself as a "Greek."</blockquote>

<p><center><img src="images/bar.gif"></center>

<P>The Greeks have been known by many names, depending on who was referring to them and when.  In Homer, they are called, "Achaeans," <img src="images/greek/achaioi.gif" align=middle>, "Dana&auml;ns," <img src="images/greek/danaoi.gif"> (which sounds like the <a href="notes/newking.htm#israel">Israelite</a> Tribe of Dan, which, as it happens, may actually have been Mycenaean Greeks), and other things.  In the Classical period, a Greek is a <img src="images/greek/hellen.gif" align=middle>, <I>Hell&ecirc;n</I>, the Greeks are the <img src="images/greek/hellenes.gif" align=middle>, <I>Hell&ecirc;nes</I>, and the country is <img src="images/greek/hellas.gif" align=middle>, <I>Hellas</I>.

<P>The Romans, however, ended up with their own words.  "Greek" is <B><I>Graecus</I></B>, the Greeks are <B><I>Graeci</I></B>, and Greece is <B><I>Graecia</I></B>.  The names in English clearly derive from Latin, but it is not clear where the Latin words have come from.  In Mediaeval Greek we see <img src="images/greek/graikoi.gif" align=middle>, <I>Graiko&iacute;</I> (singular <img src="images/greek/graikos.gif" align=middle>, <I>Graik&oacute;s</I>), which apparently has been borrowed from Latin.  However, according to Smyth's <I>Greek Grammar</I> [Herbert Weir Smyth, Harvard University Press, 1966], this word already occurs in Aristotle [p.1] -- but Smyth gives no citation and doesn't tell us what the context is in Aristotle.  While Smyth says that this "is borrowed from Latin," it is not clear why Aristotle would know about a Latin word or have any reason to borrow it.

<P>On the other hand, Smyth also says that the word in Latin may derive from <img src="images/greek/graioi.gif" align=middle>, <I>Gra&icirc;oi</I>, "a Boeotian tribe that took part in the colonization of Cyme in Italy, or from the <img src="images/greek/graioi.gif" align=middle>, a larger tribe of the same stock that lived in Eprius" [<I>ibid.</I>].  Smyth says these were "the first Hellenes of whom the Romans had knowledge."  However, if the <I>Gra&icirc;oi</I> were a "tribe... that lived in Epirus," it is not clear that they were really even Greeks -- ethnically <a href="hist-1.htm#epirus">Epirus</a> was probably Illyrian, whose modern descendants are the <a href="turkia.htm#zog">Albanians</a> -- and if the "same stock" turned up in Boeotia, where Greek "tribes" had really become artificial political divisions, it is not clear that they were really Greeks there either.  There is no telling how the Romans really latched onto this name.

<P><a name="coptictxt">South or east of Greece, we find names that derive from <img src="images/greek/ionia.gif" align=middle>, <B>Ionia</B>, where Greek philosophy began.  In Egyptian, we find <img src="images/hiero/greek.gif" align=middle>.  The Egyptians normally didn't write vowels, but we have Demotic writings of this name with the <img src="images/hiero/y-new.gif" align=middle> group, which looks like it is used for the long vowel "i," especially when this often at the end of words, making adjectives, just as Arabic does with <img src="images/greek/ya-2.gif" align=middle>.  This is confirmed when we get a version later in <a href="egypt.htm">Coptic</a>, <img src="images/greek/greek.gif" align=middle>, <I>Weinin</I>, which fits the consonsants and that vowel [<a href="#coptic">note</a>].  In Modern <a href="decdenc1.htm#note-8">Arabic</a> "Greek" or "a Greek" is <I>Y&ucirc;n&acirc;n&icirc;</I>, <img src="images/greek/yunani.gif" align=middle>, and "the Greeks" is <I>al-Y&ucirc;n&acirc;n</I>, <img src="images/greek/alyunan.gif" align=middle>.  And, far off in India, in <a href="cognates.htm#sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> "Greek" was <I>Yavana</I>, <img src="images/greek/yavana.gif" align=middle>.  <I>Yavanapura</I>, <img src="images/greek/yavanapu.gif" align=middle>, the "City of the Greeks," seems to have been the name for <a href="hist-1.htm#text-9">Alexandria</a>, Egypt.  Curiously, <img src="images/greek/yavana.gif" align=middle> would later be used even for Muslims, after they invaded <a href="sangoku.htm#maharashtra">India</a> in 644.

<P>Ionic is one of the basic <a href="archon.htm#dialects">dialects</a> of Greek, <img src="images/maps/ionia.gif" align=right>and the name is also associated with one of the canonical styles of architecture, the <B>Ionic Order</B>, which is more delicate than the Doric but still less elaborate than the Corinthian.  Ionia is also the source of what later became the standard Greek <a href="archon.htm#pronounce">alphabet</a>, with distinctive letters like "H" used for a long /<B>e</B>/, the <img src="images/greek/eta.gif" align=middle>, <I>&ecirc;ta</I>, and a new ligature, the <img src="images/greek/omega-0.gif" align=middle>, <I>&ocirc;mega</I> ("big O"), for a long /<B>o</B>/.  The consonant "h" had simply been lost in Ionic, as it is in Modern Greek.

<P>On the map we see the ten original cities of Ionia, plus Smyrna, an Aeolic city that later joined them.  The names of early Greek philosophers can be associated with several of these cities.  <B>Thales, Anaximander, and Anaximenes</B> are all from Miletus; <B>Pythagoras and Melissos</B> from Samos; <B>Heraclitus</B> from Ephesus; <B>Xenophanes</B> from Colophon; and <B>Anaxagoras</B> from Clazomenae.  Smyrna, <B>Izmir</B> in <a href="mongol.htm#aydin">Turkish</a>, is now the principal city of the area, as Ephesus had been through most of Late Antiquity (the site of the <a href="hist-1.htm#nestor">Third Ecumenical Council</a>) and the early Middle Ages.

<P>By the Middle Ages, the Greeks were no longer calling themselves <I>Hell&ecirc;nes</I>.  They were <img src="images/greek/romans.gif" align=middle>, <I>Rh&ocirc;ma&icirc;oi</I>, i.e. <B>Romans</B> (singular <I>Rh&ocirc;ma&icirc;os</I>, <img src="images/greek/roman.gif" align=middle>).  This now may seem odd, but the Roman Empire had been divided between East and West in 395 AD.  The <a href="romania.htm#anthemius">Western Empire</a> ended in 476 AD; but the remaining <a href="romania.htm#middle">Empire</a> in the East survived until Constantinople fell to the <a href="turkia.htm">Ottoman Turks</a> in 1453 AD.  The Mediaeval Greeks were thus, to themselves and to others, Romans. Historians may mention this, but -- except for <a href="republic.htm">Anthony Kaldellis</a> -- they never follow the usage and appear not to take it seriously -- Julius Caesar, now <I>that's a Roman</I>, not people like Justinian (who codified Roman Law) or Nicephorus Phocas (see epigraph).  Also, <I>Hell&ecirc;n</I> had come to mean "pagan," as the word is used in the New Testament, while "Roman," <img src="images/greek/roman.gif" align=middle>, meant "Christian."  <a href="romania.htm#flag"><img src="history/romania2.gif" align=left border=0></a>If reference was needed to Romans as speakers of the <I>Greek language</I>, <img src="images/greek/graikos.gif" align=middle> was used.  The Empire was itself <a href="decdenc1.htm#note-5"><B>Romania</B></a>, in Latin, or <img src="images/greek/romania.gif" border=0 align=middle>, in Greek, names used since at least the 4th century but generally not mentioned by historians, not even Byzantinists (except Kaldellis).

<P>Once there were German Emperors, beginning with <a href="francia.htm#caroling">Charlemagne</a>, in the West, legitimized by the <a href="popes.htm#leo">Pope</a>, they began to think of <I>themselves</I> as "Romans" (as in the <I>Sanctum Imperium Romanum</I>, the "Holy Roman Empire") and to dismiss the Emperors in Constantinople as "Greeks" or even insultingly as <B><I>Graeculi</I></B>, "Greeklings" or "Little Greeks" (singular <I>Graeculus</I>).  When they felt like being more diplomatic, however, they might use a name transcribed from <img src="images/greek/romans.gif" align=middle> back into Latin, as <B><I>Romaei</I></B> (singular <I>Romaeus</I>) or <B><I>Romei</I></B> (singular <I>Romeus</I>).  The Emperor of the Romans could not really object to being called the <I>Imperator Romaeorum</I>.  But this was rare, and <I>Romeus</I> curiously ending up meaning a pilgrim who had been to Rome; and it could even be used as a proper name for such a pilgrim (like <img src="images/greek/hajji.gif" align=middle>, <I>Hajj&icirc;</I>, a Muslim who has performed the <img src="images/greek/hajj.gif" align=middle>, <I>Hajj</I>, the Pilgrimage to <a href="islam.htm#prophet">Mecca</a>).  This became <I>Rom&eacute;e</I> in French and <I>Romeo</I> in Italian.  Yes, Romeo, as in <I>Romeo and Juliet</I>.  Had Romeo been to Rome?  Or had his name already become detached from this usage?  Because of the play, "Romeo" now usually means a kind of lover.

<P>We see another suggestion mentioned in Jame Bryce's <I>The Holy Roman Empire</I> [1904, 1923, Schocken Books, 1961]:

<P><blockquote><a href="romania.htm#angeli">Isaac Angelus</a>, more insolently, styled <a href="francia.htm#swabia">Frederick the First</a> 'chief prince of Alemannia.' The great Hohenstaufen, half resentful, half contemptuous, told the Eastern envoys that he was Romanorum Imperator, and bade their master call himself 'Romaniorum,' from the Thracian province of Romania. [p.343]</blockquote>

<P>While it is not surprising that Frederick I should have been resentful and contemptuous of the "Greeks," his suggestion is certainly less insulting and more sensible than the language used by most "Franks."  If the Empire is <I>Romania</I>, then a citizen thereof might reasonable be a <I>Romanius</I>, and this avoids the confusion with the City of Rome that the adjective <I>Romanus</I> does not.  Such a distinction was available in Greek, with <img src="images/greek/rhomanos.gif" align=middle> for the City and <img src="images/greek/roman.gif" align=middle> for the Empire.

<P>The real confusion here is in James Bryce, since there never was a "Thracian Province of Romania"; and Byrce, apparently ignorant of the Mediaeval meaning of "Romania," is thinking of his contemporary Turkish province of <I>Rumelia</I>, <img src="images/greek/rumeli.gif" align=middle><img src="images/greek/rum.gif" align=middle>, as the descendant of "Romania."  From this, we might question the depth of Byrce's scholarship, whether in Latin or Greek.

<p><center><img src="images/key.gif"></center>

<P>E.A. Wallis Budge gives us two hieroglypic and two Coptic writings of "Greek."  The two hieroglyphic writings are <img src="images/hiero/greek.gif" align=middle> and <img src="images/hiero/greek-b.gif" align=middle>, and the two Coptic writings are <img src="images/greek/greek.gif" align=middle>, <I>Weinin</I>, and <img src="images/greek/greek2.gif" align=middle>, <I>Weeienin</I> [<I>An Egyptian Hieroglyphic Dictionary</I>, Volume II, John Murray, London, 1920, Dover Publications, 1978, p.960].  Other Egyptian dictionaries I have available, such as those Alan Gardiner [1927, 1964], Raymond O. Faulker [1962], and Bill Petty [2012], do not have a word for "Greek," probably because it is from Late Egyptian.

<P>The phonetic value of the "eye" glyph, <img src="images/hiero/eye1.gif" align=middle>, is with some kind of semi-vowel (no one is quite sure what the value of the phoneme is) and an "r."  Because of this, Budge vocalizes the word with an extra syllable, as <B>Aruna</B> or <B>Auna</B>; but if the Coptic writings are any guide, this is a mistake, and the eye is only ideographic, although of obscure import.  The first hieroglyphic writing ends with determinatives for "foreign" and "land."  In the second writing, we find a glottal stop, <img src="images/hiero/3-new.gif" align=middle>, added.

<P>The Coptic writings both clarify and obscure matters.  The first one, <img src="images/greek/greek.gif" align=middle>, is clear enough.  The "ou" digraph, as with <a href="archon.htm#pronounce">Greek</a> <img src="images/greek/greek-u.gif" align=middle> (or the French "ou" in the same position), is read as a "w."  This followed by "ei," which, like the contemporary Greek <img src="images/greek/greek-ei.gif" align=middle> is certain to be read as a long "i."  This confirms the reading of Demotic <img src="images/hiero/y-new.gif" align=middle> mentioned above.  Our last clue here is that the double "n" in the hieroglyphic writing does indeed mean a double "n," separated by the vowel "i."  So we get a reading of <B>W&icirc;nin</B> for "Greek."

<P>The other Coptic writing, <img src="images/greek/greek2.gif" align=middle>, is what raises questions.  We have two extra vowels here.  What is going on?  If they meaning anything, it must mean that we have more than one vowel, with a separation by a glottal stop, glide, or something.  And the "eei" may have a diphthong value that <img src="images/greek/greek-ei.gif" align=middle> originally had in Greek but then lost.  The third "e," in turn, may suggest the role of the glottal stop in the second hieroglyphic writing.  I am tempted to suggest a new, combined hieroglyphic writing, as <img src="images/hiero/greek-d.gif" align=middle>; but, really, the matter must remain obscure.

<P>We don't know how good Greek traders would have looked (olive oil in the hair is not fashionable at the moment), but everything else certainly fits, and success did follow.

<P>Beldar Conehead takes Sinbad's advice.  He is self-employed as a driving instructor, where he is not behind a desk, and he only takes cash.  It is not clear whether this is a legitimate, licensed business which pays taxes.  Beldar's attempt at aquiring a stolden identity earlier in the movie has fallen through, and we see no attempt to duplicate its advantages.  The INS (Immigration and Naturalization Service, which has since been renamed) is after him, but the IRS doesn't put in an appearance.

<P>Miriam Lichtheim, <I>Ancient Egyptian Literature, Volume I:  The Old and Middle Kingdoms</I>, University of California Press, 1973, p. 183.

<P>Lichtheim argues rather awkwardly that the text is intended as a "satire" because the "scribal profession" never would have harbored "a contempt for manual labor so profound as to be unrelieved by humor."  Instead, the Egyptians are supposed to have uniformly taken "joy and pride in the accomplishments of labor" and have taught "respect for all labor" (p. 184).  However, one does not have to have either contempt or respect to recognize that manual labor in an ancient society, with nothing in the way of modern medicine and when the average life-span was only about 35 years, was hard, merciless, and ravaging.  A text that begins "I have seen many beatings" must be expected to be offering a sober caution, if indeed there <I>were</I> "many beatings," which, as it happens, is undeniable.  Why there is any particular dignity in getting beaten by tax collectors, or why a scribal writer would want to satirize it, is more than a little mysterious.  No, the concern for the dignity of labor here is modern and editorial, if not Marxist, and the intention of the author of the text is clearly the very serious recommendation of scribal life, attended with reading, writing, and authority, over the hard labor and social subordination of other professions.

<P>The origin of the word "Phoenician" is a matter of interest.  "Phoenicia" in Phoenician was <B>P&ucirc;t</B> and both the Phoenician people and the Phoenician language were <B>P&ocirc;nn&icirc;m</B> [<I>A Phoenician-Punic Grammar</I>,

by Charles R. Krahmalkov, Brill, Leiden, 2001, p.1].  Latin <B>Poeni</B> for Cathaginians and the adjective <B>Punicus</B> look like they come directly from the Phoenician words.

<P>The Greek word from which we actually get the words "Phoenicia" and "Phoenician," <B>Phoin&iacute;ke</B>, <img src="images/greek/phoenice.gif" align=middle>, however, looks a little different.  <B>Phoinix</B>, <img src="images/greek/phoinix.gif" align=middle>, in Greek is the noun, "Phoenician."  The root here is <B>Phoinik-</B>, and this has an extra consonant in it in comparison to the Phoenician root.  The word could be seen as having a Greek adjectival ending, <B>-ik-</B>, and we might think the way to analyze it is as coming from an adjective <B>Phoin-ik-os</B>.  But this will not do. <B>Phoinix</B> is a Third Declension noun, and we must analyze it as <B>Phoinik-s</B>, in the nominative, as it is <B>Phoinik-os</B> in the genitive.  A Greek adjective of <B>Phoinix</B> is actually <B>Phoinikikos</B>, <img src="images/greek/phoiniki.gif" align=middle>, where the adjectival ending <B>-ik-os</B> goes onto the root <B>Phoinik-</B>.  And we already see <B>po-ni-ke</B> in Mycenaean Greek.  We thus must account for the extra consonant in the root.

<P><B>Phoinix</B> may actually be a borrowing from Egyptian.  <B>Fn<u>kh</u>w</B>, <img src="images/hiero/fnkhw.gif" align=middle>, in Egyptian meant "Syrians" [<I>Egyptian Grammar</I>, Sir Alan Gardiner, Oxford University Press, 1927, 1964, p.566], and if the Greeks, who had extensive involvement with the Egyptians, borrowed this word, that would account for the extra consonant.

<P>The <B>Fn</B> portion of the root, of course, looks like it would correspond to the word in Phoenician, which may leave us wondering:  &nbsp;If the Egyptian word was originally borrowed from Phoenician, where did the <I>Egyptians</I> get the third consonant?  As it happens, Phoenician phonology originally had a consonant <B><u>kh</u></B> (<img src="images/greek/khi.gif" align=middle>), which was subsequently lost [Krahmalkov, p.19].  It is possible that an earlier stage of the Phoenician language had that consonant in its root -- three consonsant roots are the norm in <a href="trees.htm#semitic">Semitic Languages</a> -- which is where the Egyptians got it.  It is also possible, of course, that the Greeks got to the Phoenicians early enough that they also got <I>their</I> third consonant directly from the Phoenician word; but since the consonant is not attested in written Phoenician, and the Egyptians were dealing with the Phoenicians <I>two thousand years</I> before the Greeks were (when Phoenician was not written), they would have been in a better position to pick up long lost consonants.

<P>While <img src="images/greek/pho-pur.gif" align=middle> is puzzling for the extra consonant in the root, it is also used to mean "purple, purple-red, crimson," i.e. the color of the dye Tyrian Purple.   In those terms we also have <B>phoin&oacute;s</B>, <img src="images/greek/phoinos.gif" align=middle>, which means "blood-red, blood-stained, murderous."  If these meanings are comparable, and  <img src="images/greek/phoinos.gif" align=middle> looks like the Phoenician word for "Phoenician," then perhaps Greek has directly borrowed the Phoenician word after all, but is only using it for the color and not the people [cf. Carolina L&oacute;pez-Ruiz, <I>When the Gods Were Born, Greek Cosmologies and the Near East</I>, Harvard, 2010, p.24 -- suggesting that <B>pho&icirc;nix</B> derives from <B>phoin&oacute;s</B>, without addressing the morphological question of the extra <B>-k-</B>].  On the other hand, the Liddell and Scott <I>Intermediate Greek-English Lexicon</I> [Oxford, Clarendon, 1889, 1964] derives <B>phoin&oacute;s</B> from <B>ph&oacute;nos</B>, <img src="images/greek/phonos.gif" align=middle>, "murder, slaughter" [p.869].  However, I don't understand the morphology of this alteration either.  An infixed "i" may be part of some regular word formation, but I am unfamiliar with it.  Semantically, <B>phoin&oacute;s</B> does seem to go with <B>ph&oacute;nos</B>, which would leave it unrelated to the word for "Phoenician" in Phoenician.  There are problems either way.

<P>The geographic backbone of Phoenicia, Mount Lebanon, had the same name then as now:  &nbsp;<B>Lebanon</B> (<B>Lbnn</B>) -- rendered by the Egyptians as <B>Rmnn</B>, <img src="images/hiero/lebanon.gif" align=middle>.  It is <B>Lubn&acirc;n</B>, <img src="images/lubnan.gif" align=middle>, in Arabic.

From "mountain," the root <B>GBL</B> (<img src="images/greek/jabal.gif" align=middle>, <I>jabal</I> in Arabic), came the name of one of the principal Phoenician cities, <B>Gubla</B>, rendered by the Greeks as <B>Byblos</B>, <img src="images/greek/byblos.gif" align=middle>.

<P>This also became a Greek word for Egyptian <I>papyrus</I>, otherwise <img src="images/greek/papyrus.gif" align=middle>, probably traded by Byblos, and so, more commonly as <B>biblos</B>, a word for "book," or <B>biblion</B>, <img src="images/greek/book.gif" align=middle>.  Indeed, no papyrus grew in Phoenicia, so the Greeks, at least initially, certainly knew about the material as it was provided by Phoenician traders.  Later, the Greeks went to Egypt and could buy their own papyrus, but the words of Phoenician original persisted.

<P>The initial slope of the pyramid was not really too steep, at 54<sup>o</sup>27'44", even though the pyramid was finished at 43<sup>o</sup>22'.  The angle of the Great Pyramid of Khufu would soon be 51<sup>o</sup>50'40"; and the pyramid of Khafre would have an angle of 53<sup>o</sup>10'.  Instead the Bent Pyramid suffered from problems with the developing technology:

<P><blockquote>It was this combination of a lack of good mortar, carelessly laid blocks, and, most importantly, the unstable desert surface, that caused the structural problems. [Mark Lehner, <I>The Complete Pyramids</I>,Thames and Hudson, 1997, p. 102]</blockquote>

<P>If the pyramid had been continued as planned, the weight of stone above, due to the foundation and structural problems, would have crushed the chambers within or caused a collapse of the sides.  This was solved by flattening off the slope, resulting in the famous "bent" shape of the pyramid.  Seneferu seems to have been displeased enough to order a complete new pyramid built, which was subsequently finished as the first true pyramid, the "Northern" pyramid at Dahshur.

<P>Fans of <I>Star Trek</I> may recognize the word "archon" from the classic <I>Star Trek</I> episode "The Return of the Archons," #22 in the original series, which aired February 9, 1967.  The "archons" referred to were the crew of the starship <I>Archon</I>, which had been captured and the crew "absorbed" by the mind-controlling, totalitarian regime of a planet ruled by a computer impersonating an ancient legislator named "Landru" (rather like Sparta's Lycurgus).  The episode ends with Captain Kirk in one of his classic moments arguing the computer into a nervous breakdown, freeing the planet.

<P>A <I>tyrant</I>, <img src="images/greek/tyrant.gif" align=middle>, <I>t&yacute;rannos</I>, in Greek history basically meant an autocratic ruler who was simply not a traditional <I>king</I>, a <img src="images/greek/basileu2.gif" align=middle>, <I>basile&uacute;s</I>.  The kings were part of a <I>tradition</I>, usually hereditary, and had significant <I>religious</I> duties.  A tyrant, on the other hand, came to power through secular political means, often by force, and they maintained their position by force, popularity, or both.  Thus, "tyrant" did not originally mean a criminal; but the behavior of tyrants rapidly began to give the word the meaning it would have today, commiting crimes that often were also seen as <I>offenses</I> against religion; and philosophers like <a href="plato.htm">Plato</a> analyzed the tyrant as possessing an immoral sort of <I>personality type</I>.

<P>The difference between traditional kings and the tyrants was nicely expressed by Fustel de Coulanges:

<P><blockquote>When the kings had been everywhere overthrown, and the aristocracy had become supreme, the people did not content themselves with regretting the monarchy; they aspired to restore it under a new form.  In Greece, during the sixth century, they succeeded generally in procuring leaders; not wishing to call them kings, because this title implied the idea of religious functions, and could only be borne by sacerdotal families, they called them tyrants.  [Numa Denis Fustel de Coulanges, <I>The Ancient City, A Study of the Religion, Laws, and Institutions of Greece and Rome</I>, translated by Willard Small, 1874, Doubleday & Company, 1955, Dover Publications, 2006, p.270-271; <I>La cit&eacute; antique</I>, 1865]</blockquote>

<P>The sort of conduct characteristic of tyrants was illustrated by Aristotle with an anecdote:

<P><blockquote>Hence comes the advice of Periander to Thrasybulus, his docking of the prominent cornstalks, meaning that the prominent citizens [<img src="images/greek/the-apm.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/prominen.gif" align=middle>] must always be made away with. [<I>Politics</I>, V, viii, 7, translated by H. Rackham, 1932, 1998, Loeb Classical Library, Harvard University Press, p.442-443]</blockquote>

<P>Periander, the tyrant of Corinth (d.585 BC), asked Thrasybulus, who was the tyrant of Miletus (d.600 BC), how to govern.  Silently, walking through the fields outside Miletus with Periander's representative, Thryasybulus demonstrated his technique by cutting off the tops of the grainstalks that stood up higher than the others.  Thus, anyone who might become a focus for opposition to a tyrant should be eliminated.  Aristotle has turned around who gave the advice to whom.  Of course, it didn't much matter.  Periander was also famous for murdering his wife and other crimes.

<P>Greek tyrants didn't always <I>kill</I> their opposition, both because exile was easy and effective, and in ancient religion one always worried about venegeful spirits causing trouble (a motif familiar in <a href="sangoku.htm#japan">Japanese</a> history that recently has spawned novels and movies).  The most striking case may have involved Polycrates, the tyrant of Samos (d.523).  He had to deal with one of the most prominent citizens of Samos, and also one of the most prominent persons of the age, the philosopher <a href="music.htm">Pythagoras</a>.  The result, of course, was that around 531 Pythagoras fled, all the way to Croton in Italy.  There, his danger as a political leader was revealed when his followers took over the city and he became a tyrant himself.  Since the Pythagorean community banned beans, <a href="why.htm#note-3">Bertrand Russell</a> joked that Pythagoras was soon overthrown because the masses hungered after beans.  So Pythagoras had to flee again, to nearby Metapontum, where he lived out his life.

<P>While tyrants were never called kings, we sometimes find people we would consider kings called tyrants.  Thus, perhaps the most famous play by Sophocles is usually called, in Latin, <I>Oedipus Rex</I>, or "Oedipus the King."  However, a more accurate translation would be <I>Oedipus Tyrannus</I>, because Sophocles does call him a tyrant, not a king.  Why this is so may be evident from the story.  Oedipus does not inherit the throne of Thebes but obtains it by passing the test of answering the riddle of the sphinx -- although he happens to be the one who killed the previous king, not realizing that this was actually his father.  Trouble continues as he unknowingly marries the king's widow, his own mother.  The breaches of religion involved (the blood <a href="newotto.htm">pollution</a> of murder, and incest) soon resulted in ill fortune, sent by the gods, afflicting the city.  Thus, in many ways Oedipus did not enjoy the sanction of religion as a ruler, making him more tyrant than king.

<P>"Tyrant" ceased to be a title and became only a term of abuse during the Hellenistic Age.  A proper monarchy, that of <a href="#macedon">Macedonia</a>, came to rule Greece and the Middle East through <a href="hist-1.htm#great">Alexander the Great</a>.  After the death of Alexander, his generals soon claimed kingship themselves, as the "Successors," <img src="images/greek/diadochi.gif" align=middle>, the <a href="hist-1.htm#diadochi">Diadochi</a>.  This did not have the same religious sanction as traditional kings, but the precedent of Alexander himself created a new form of this, that the Hellenistic Kings are <I>themselves</I> gods.  For instance, the official name of <a href="hist-1.htm#text-9">Cleopatra (VII)</a> herself included <img src="images/greek/goddess.gif" align=middle>, <I>th&eacute;a</I>, "goddess."

<P>Recent arguments about the origin of money have been discussed in "Money's Murky Origins," by Bruce Bower, in <I>Science News</I> [Volume 194, No. 3, August 4, 2018, pp.16-21].  A key statement in the article runs thus:

<P><blockquote>Coins stamped with images of animals or rulers, guaranteeing the metal's value, first appeared in the kingdom of Lydia, in what's now Turkey, around 2,600 years ago.  Soon after, cities and states in Greece, Persia, India and China began to strike their own coins.  From the start, coins funded armies and wars of conquest.  In the process, coins became legal tender for all sorts of transactions.  Marketplaces were a result of the sytem, not its cause, revisionists argue. [p.17]</blockquote>

<P>Unfortunately for the "revisionists," who see money as an instrument of state, not initially of trade and markets, the Lydians and the Greek cities associated with them, like Miletus and Ephesus (i.e. <a href="#coptictxt">Ionia</a>), were traders, not conquerors, and their coins were not introduced to fund, and did not "from the start" fund, "armies and wars of conquest."  There were no such things -- although Lydia eventually made a couple of abortive efforts in that direction.  And the <a href="#persia">Persian Empire</a>, let alone earlier states, like <a href="#assyria">Assyria</a>, was created before this innovation had any chance to have an effect on its practices.  The coinage, for instance, of Darius (522-486), postdates the creation of the Empire by Cyrus (640-600) and Cambyses (600-559), who were more or less contemporaneous with the introduction of coinage.  So the expression above, "soon after," conceals the lack of actual connection, and the mismatched dates, between the two phenomena.  So, indeed, markets came first, not state funding of armies and wars.

<P>This is especially noteworthy with <a href="sangoku.htm#china">China</a>, which has been incautiously included in the list of conquerors.  Traditional China never used more than one kind of coin, the small brass "cash" coin with a square hole in the center.  This was never worth much, and it was intentionally made that way, as a convenience, not for merchants or businesses, but for the daily, small transactions of ordinary people.  The cash coins were worth so little that later, when the Spanish silver dollar was introduced, it was rated as worth 1000 cash.  This all was because <a href="six.htm#confucian">Confucians</a> did not trust merchants or businessmen, who were left to provide their own appropriate medium of exchange in silver ingots.  Gold was a state monopoly, precisely to fund "armies and wars of conquest," although Confucians actually didn't care much for those activities either, which left China relatively helpless in the face of conquest by <a href="sangoku.htm#ch'ing">Manchuria</a>.  And there never were gold coins, even when the Manchu Qing Dynasty began adopting Western coinage.  The hole in the coins was conveniently used to string together 50, 100, or whatever at a time.

<P>So, whether it is Mr. Bower or the "revisionists" -- with only David Graeber [<I>Debt: The First 5,000 Years</I>, Melville House, 2011], actually given with a reference in the article -- they seem to be seriously out of their reckoning when it comes to the history of money, or even just history.  We might wonder why.  Does David Graeber have some kind of agenda?

<P>Well, the "revisionists" seem to reject a basic principle of liberal democracy, which is that "governments are instituted among men to secure these rights," i.e. the natural rights of the <a href="nature.htm">State of Nature</a>.  After all, when the Phoenicians landed on a distant shore and set about trading with the natives, they were operating in a State of Nature.  When markets were later governed by laws, this was to prevent the abuses that might occur in such situations, i.e. violence, theft, fraud, etc.

<P>But if money derives from functions of state, and not from the natural conditions of markets, then the State has ontological priority.  The "revisionists" may believe this because they are <a href="hegel.htm">Hegelians</a> and statists, for whom government and the state are more real than individuals, have natural authority over them, and which condescend to dispense rights to citizens, for its benefit, not for theirs.  This is the paradigm of <a href="rand.htm#modern">leftist</a> politics from the 20th century into the 21st.  It is not clear from this one article if that is what is going on, but suspicion is warranted in the increasingly totalitarian modern academy.

<P>Some people like to think that the wealth of Athens derived from the <B>Laurion</B> silver mines.  But this is to make a fundamental mistake about the nature of wealth -- an instance of "<a href="trade.htm#note-1">Cargo Cult</a>" economics.  Money is worthless without something to buy.  Even gold, without commerce, may as well be used, as the Egyptians did, to make or cover <I>coffins</I>.  If goods are produced, then it doesn't matter <B>who</B> has the gold or silver, it will run, like water, to the producers.

<P>A prime example of that is the great flood of metal from the silver mines of Mexico and Peru, starting in the 16th century, which all went to <a href="perifran.htm#conquest"><B>Spain</B></a>.  Since Spain was not a commercial or manufacturing power, it simply spent the money.  That helped make it a predominant power for over a century, but the money, when spent, then went to the commercial states, like the Netherlands and England.  The <a href="lorraine.htm#netherlands">Netherlands</a>, small as it was, then demonstrated a new order of economic strength by successfully revolting against Spain.  All that all of the silver had done to the Spanish economy was to produce a raging <a href="money.htm">inflation</a> -- always the result of too much money chasing too few goods.  Athens suffered no such embarrassments.  It could absorb its own silver, and much, much more, like the "tribute" from the <B>League of Delos</B>, because of the strength of its own economy.

<P>The Greek historian of philosophy Diogenes Laertius, refers to a lost work, that of Hieronymus of Rhodes, crediting Thales with "measuring the pyramids by their shadow, having observed the time when our own shadow is equal to our height" (G.S. Kirk & J.E. Raven, <I>The Presocratic Philosophers</I>, Cambridge, 1964, p. 83).  This would be a little awkward, since one's own height would have to be ascertained and the shadow measured by it.  Since the gnomon -- a stick in the ground -- was in use at the time to observe the path of the sun, using one would be considerably easier and just as simple.

<P>The case of the playwright <B>Bertolt Brecht</B> (18981956) is revealing.  Brecht, a life-long Marxist and Communist, was called before the House Un-American Activies Committee (HUAAC) in 1947 when the Committee was investigating people in Hollywood with Communist connections -- including the "Hollyood Ten," now celebtrated as Martyrs by Marxists at all American universities and among the <I>bien pensants</I> of American letters and politics.  Brecht, one of the Ten, nevertheless testified freely and impressed the Committee as a "friendly witness."  Falsely denying all knowledge of Communists, Brecht avoided citation for Contempt of Congress, and probable jail time, by leaving the country the next day and never returning.  He defected to East Germany, where he retained a residence the rest of his life.

<P>This counter-example to the western intellectuals who "voted with their feet" by staying in Capitalist countries is countered in turn by the deal that Brecht made with the East Germans.  He kept an Austrian passport, which enabled him to leave East Germany and travel, as few other East Germans could.  He kept his money in Swiss bank accounts, where no Communist regime had access to it.  And he kept a West German publisher, who paid the considerable royalties from his works into his Swiss bank accounts.  It also now appears that some of his works had been plagiarized from younger, especially female, associates.

<P>The hypocrisy and cynicism of Brecht's behavior and arrangements is almost charming, but it certainly explodes the notion that he defected to East Germany so that he could enjoy the benefits of living under actual Communism.  He managed to avoid all the disabilities that would have applied to real East Germans, who would be safely imprisoned by the Berlin Wall in 1961.  Brecht, we might say, added insult to injury by congratulating the East German government when it put down the 1953 uprising (by "the workers," as it happened).  Brecht was thus the <I>perfect</I> leftist intellectual, enjoying the freedom himself that he was happy to see denied to others.

<H1 ALIGN="center">Parmenides of Elea<br>and the <I>Way of Truth</I></H1>

<P><center><img src="images/key.gif"></center>

<P><B>Parmenides of Elea</B>, <img src="images/greek/parmenid.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/the-mas.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/eleates.gif" align=middle> (born c. 515; <a href="#note-22">note</a>), is one of the most important Presocratic philosophers and represents a major turning point in the development of Greek thought.  We can credit Parmenides with two major innovations:

<ol><li><B>Dialectic</B>, <img src="images/greek/the-fem.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/dialectc.gif" align=middle><B>:</B><br>
To the Greeks, this simply meant <I><B>logical argumentation</B></I>.  This represents a break with a characteristic of mythpoeic thought that had persisted through the first Greek philosophers, namely the fourth characteristic, that myth is <a href="#justify">self-justifying</a>.  As handed down to us, earlier philosophers, like Anaximander and Heracltius, simply <B>assert</B> what is true.  They do not, to our knowledge, offer arguments.  Where they begin to notice their own disagreements, there is not much they can say about each other except that they are right and the others are wrong.  Heraclitus is supposed to have said:

<P><blockquote>Much learning [<img src="images/greek/polymath.gif" align=middle>, "polymathy," in the Ionic <a href="archon.htm#dialects">dialect</a>] does not teach intelligence [or "mind," Ionic <img src="images/greek/noos.gif" align=middle>, <I>no&oacute;s</I>, Attic <img src="images/greek/nous.gif" align=middle>, <I>no&ucirc;s</I>], or it would have taught Hesiod and Pythagoras, Xenophanes and Hecataeus. [Diogenes Laertius]</blockquote>

<P>Although Parmenides's poem, the <I>Way of Truth</I>, begins with the invocation of an unnamed goddess, in standard mythic form, the goddess provides arguments, rendering her own authority superfluous.

<P>The meaning of the word "dialectic" (from which is derived "dialogue") now has drifted far from its original sense, because of special technical meanings attributed to it by philosophers like <a href="kant.htm">Kant</a>, <a href="hegel.htm">Hegel</a>, and <a href="marx.htm">Marx</a>.  Also, the etymology of the word is commonly misunderstood, as when people say that a "dialogue" involves <B>two</B> people because <B>di-</B> means "two."  Well <I>di-</I> <B>can</B> mean two (from <I>dis</I>, "double"), but it does <B>not</B> in "dialectic" or "dialogue" since the element is <B>dia-</B> rather than <I>di-</I>.  <B>Dia</B>, <img src="images/greek/dia.gif" align=middle>, is a Greek preposition that means "through."  "Discourse," from Latin (<I>discursus</I>), would be the most appropriate translation of the Greek meaning.

<P><li><a name="parmmeta"><B>Metaphysics</B>, <img src="images/greek/meta-cap.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/the-np.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/physikac.gif" align=middle><B>:</B>
<br>The meaning of the word "metaphysics" is also commonly misconstrued.  On television or in New Age literature (one thinks of Shirley MacLaine and her books like <I>Out on a Limb</I> -- made into a TV movie in 1987), one is liable to hear that the word "metaphysics" means "beyond" (<img src="images/greek/meta.gif" align=middle>, <I>meta</I>) the "physical" (<img src="images/greek/physika.gif" align=middle>, <I>physics</I>).  Thus "metaphysics" would be about spiritual things, God, the soul, ghosts, etc.  Unfortunately, the Greek preposition <B>meta</B> does not mean "beyond"; it means "after."  This might be thought to amount to the same thing, but it doesn't, because of the actual origin of the word.  <I><B>Metaphysics</B></I> was originally the title of a <B>book</B>, by Aristotle.  It got that name by accident.

<P>When Aristotle died (in 322), none of his mature thought had been published.  All that remained of his teachings at his school, the <a href="euthyph.htm#academy">Lyceum</a>, were his lecture notes, sometimes even his students' lecture notes.  Before long, his family and students decided that something should be done about that, and the material was gradually organized, divided, and published.  The appropriate names for many of the books were obvious (<I>On the Heavens</I>, <I>On the Soul</I>, <I>The Parts of Animals</I>, etc.).  After the <I>Physics</I> (<I>physika</I>, "natural things," from <I>physis</I>, "nature") was published, however, it was not obvious what to call the next book, since it had material about God and a number of other things in it.  Rather than picking one topic, the book simply began to be called the "After the Physics" (<img src="images/greek/meta-cap.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/the-np.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/physikac.gif" align=middle>, <I><B>Meta ta Physika</B></I>).  The name stuck.  So the word "metaphysics" really doesn't mean anything etymologically.  It would basically mean whatever was in Aristotle's <I>Metaphysics</I>.

<P>What <B>was</B> basic in the <I>Metaphysics</I> was something for which a word did not exist in Greek philosophy.  A modern word has been coined from Greek, however:  &nbsp;<B>"Ontology"</B>, for the philosophical discipline that is <B>the first and principle part of metaphysics</B>.  "Ontology" (<img src="images/greek/ontology.gif" align=middle>, <I>ontologia</I>) means "talking" (<I>-logia</I>) about "being" (<I>&ocirc;n / onto-</I>).  This is literally what <B>Parmenides</B> did, as will be seen below -- to talk about Being.  More generally, "ontology" is the theory about <b>what is real</B>.  It is often said to be the study of "Being <I>qua</I> Being," or of what Aristotle called the <img src="images/greek/ontos.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/onta.gif" align=middle>, <I>ont&ocirc;s &oacute;nta</I>, the "beingly beings," or most real things.  This is why the popular meaning of "metaphysics" is incorrect.  Any theory that is an answer to the question, "What is real?" is an ontological, and so metaphysical, theory.  That is true whether one answers "spirits" or even "matter."  <a href="matter.htm"><I>Materialism</I></a> is just as much metaphysics as its denial.  Indeed, in a Physics class, little attention is going to paid to the question, "What is real?"

<P>Talking about Being, Parmenides founds abstract metaphysics.  There are other disciplines that later (as in Aristotle) fall into metaphysics:  &nbsp;especially <B>cosmology</B>, the theory of the structure and history of the universe, <B>natural theology</B>, theories about God based on reason rather than revelation, and <B>rational psychology</B>, the rational metaphysics of the soul.  The modern equivalent of the latter would be <B>philosophy of mind</B>.  Cosmology has now largely been absorbed by astronomy and physics, but some residual metaphysical issues remain, such as the nature of space and time.
</ol>

<P>These two innovations of Parmenides are presented in the form of an epic poem, the <I>Way of Truth</I>.  Fragments of it survive in quotations by later writers, some of them <B>much</B> later:  Proclus lived in the 5th century AD, Simplicius in the 6th.  So, a <a href="hist-1.htm#late"><B>thousand years</B></a> after Parmenides, Simplicius supplies us with extensive quotations, because he himself had difficulty finding complete texts of Parmenides.  Those are now lost, but Simplicius remains.

<P>The steeds that carried me took me as far as my heart</a> could desire, when once they had brought me and set me on the renowned way of the goddess, who leads the man who knows through every town.</blockquote>

<P>Parmenides may be the first Greek philosopher to offer a careful argument, derived from and based on reason, for his views.  Nevertheless, he wrote a traditional poetic invocation of a Muse-like goddess for his philosophical poem.  Thus we look back to the <I>inspiration</I> that the poets, and perhaps the first philosophers, claimed as the authority for their statements, even as we look forward to the appeal to logic made by all later philosophers.  The goddess remains unnamed, as happens in Homer, quite commonly in ancient religion, and even in the case of Socrates in the <a href="apology.htm"><I>Apology</I></a>.

<blockquote>....And the axle [of the chariot], blazing in the socket, was making the holes in the naves sing -- for it was urged round by well-turned wheels at each end -- while the daughters of the Sun, hasting to convey me into the light, threw back the veils from off their faces and left the abode of night.  There are the gates of the ways of Night and Day, fitted above with a lintel and below with a threshold of stone.  They themselves, high in the air, are closed by mighty doors, and avenging Justice controls the double bolts.  Her did the maidens entreat with gentle words and cunningly persuade to unfasten without demur the bolted bar from the gates.  Then, when the doors were thrown back, they disclosed a wide opening, when their brazen posts, fitted with rivets and nails, swung in turn on their hinges.  Straight through them, on the broad way, did the maidens guide the horses and the car.  And the goddess greeted me kindly, and took my right hand in hers, and spoke to me these words:

<P>"Welcome, O youth, who comes to my abode in the car that bears you, tended by immortal charioteers.  It is no ill chance, but right and justice, that has sent you forth to travel on this way.  Far indeed does it lie from the beaten track of men.  Now it is that you should learn all things, both the unshaken heart of well rounded truth and the opinion of mortals in which is no true belief at all.  Yet none the less shall you learn these things also -- how the things that seem, as they all pass through everything, must gain the semblance of being.

<P><I>[Fragments 2 & 3, from Proclus]</I>

<P>"Come now and I will tell you -- and do hearken and carry</a> my word away -- the only ways of enquiry that can be thought of [that exist for thinking]:  the one way, that it is and cannot not be, is the path of Persuasion, for it attends upon Truth;</blockquote>

<P>This is the way in which we only talk about Being.  Notice that the entire rest of the poem is a quotation from the goddess.

<P><blockquote>"the other, that it is not and cannot be, that I tell you is a path altogether unthinkable.</blockquote>

<P>The way in which we only talk about Not Being.  This turns out <I>not</I> to be a real way of inquiry, because to think about something implies that it is, in some way, while Not Being is <I>not</I>, by definition, in <I>any</I> way.  Hence such a way is "unthinkable."  This is the essence of Parmenides' argument.

<P><blockquote>"For you could not know that which is not (that is impossible) nor utter it; for the same thing can be thought as can be [<img src="images/greek/greek-01.gif" align=middle> -- the same thing exists for thinking as for being].

<P><I>[Fragment 6, from Simplicius]</I>

<P>"That which can be spoken and thought must be;</a> for it is possible for it, but not for nothing, to be; that is what I bid you ponder.  This [i.e. Not Being] is the first way of enquiry from which I hold you back, and then from that way also on which mortals wander knowing nothing, two-headed;</blockquote>

<P>The way in which we talk about <I>both</I> Being <I>and</I> Not Being, i.e. the way in which we talk about the visible world, where one and the same thing may exist at one time and not exist at another.  This need of ours to talk that way about this world invalidates it for Parmenides.

<P><blockquote>"for helplessness guides the wandering thought in their breasts; they are carried along, deaf and blind at once, altogether dazed -- hordes devoid of judgment, who are persuaded that to be and to be not are the same, yet not the same, and for whom the path of all things is backward turning.</blockquote>

<P>The traditional critique of Parmenides, starting with Plato, is that he was confusing the "existential" use of "is," as in "This thing <B>is</B>" (meaning "This thing exists"), with the "predicative" use of "is," as in "This thing <B>is blue</B>."  Thus, it is said, Parmenides' rejection of "it is not" discourse is based on a confusion, applying principles that may be appropriate to the existential use of "is" to "is" that has a different meaning -- many languages have "nominal sentences" where a verb is not even used for predication.  However, Parmenides never uses <I>any</I> predications with "it is not."  When Parmenides accuses the "hordes devoid of judgment" of believing that "to be and to be not are the same, yet not the same," there is no indication or necessity that he is talking about predication.  Instead, he is reasonably and consistently to be interpreted as accusing people of believing that "to exist and not to exist are the same, yet not the same," for this is actually how we do speak of the objects of experience, which are said to exist at one time and not to exist at another.  We also talk about "fictional objects," like Sherlock Holmes or Obi-wan Kenobi, which exist in some way but not really in "reality."  And there are mathematical objects, which seem rather basic to "reality" but are not things we find lying around in ordinary experience, or cannot exist in ordinary experience, e.g. geometrical points.  This is now called the problem of "non-existent objects," famously explored by the Austrian philosopher <B>Alexius Meinong</B> (1853-1921).  There are various ways to solve it, but it is not based on the kind of confusion of which Parmenides is commonly accused.

<P><blockquote><I>[Fragment 7, from Plato]</I>

<P>"For never shall this be proved, that things that are not are; but do hold back your thought from this way of enquiry, nor let custom, born of much experience, force you to let wander along this road your aimless eye, your echoing ear or your tongue; but do judge by reason (<I>l&oacute;gos</I>) the strife encompassed proof that I have spoken.

<P><I>[Fragment 8, from Simplicius]</I>

<P>"One way only is left to be spoken of, that it is;</a> and on this way are full many signs that what is is uncreated and imperishable; for it is entire, immovable and without end.  It was not in the past, nor shall it be, since it is now, all at once, One,</blockquote>

<P>The "One" became the common name for Being as it was described by Parmenides.

<P><blockquote>"continuous; for what creation will you seek for it?  How and whence did it grow?  Nor shall I allow you to say or to think, "from that which is not"; for it is not be said or thought that it is not.  And what need would have driven it on to grow, starting from nothing, at a later time rather than an earlier?</blockquote>

<P>This is called an argument from "sufficient reason," because in an empty eternity there would be no reason why Being would come into being at one time rather than another.  This argument is now especially associated with the German philosopher <a href="leibniz.htm">Leibniz</a>.

<P><blockquote>"Thus it must either completely be or be not.  Nor will the force of true belief allow that, beside what is, there could also arise anything from what is not.  Because of this Justice</blockquote>

<P>What is the force of logic?  Parmenides, who is here appealing to logic for perhaps the first time in history, nevertheless thinks of its sanction as one of divine justice enforced by a goddess.

<P><a name="hamlet"><blockquote>"does not loosen her fetters to allow it to come into being or perish, but holds it fast; and the decision on these matters rests here:  it is or it is not (<img src="images/greek/tobeorno.gif" align=middle>, <I>&eacute;stin &ecirc; ouk &eacute;stin</I>).</blockquote>

<P>A key phrase in Parmenides.  What the principle would rule out is the idea of <I>degrees</I> of existence such as is found in the <a href="hist-1.htm#late">Neoplatonists</a> or <a href="hist-2.htm#descartes">Descartes</a>.  It also sounds a bit like the phrase in <a href="notes/hamlet.htm">Hamlet</a>, "To be, or not to be," <img src="images/greek/tobeorno.gif" align=middle>, which begins Hamlet's consideration whether to commit suicide.  Hamlet rejects suicide, since he cannot be sure it will really deliver him from his existence and his troubles.  Parmenides, of course, would say that non-existence is impossible.  This echoes the similar argument of the <a href="gita.htm#unreal"><I>Bhagavad Gita</I></a> [2:16].  While the principle is otherwise rarely used in the history of philosophy to establish personal immortality, it nevertheless survives even in <I>physics</I> as the principle of the <I>conservation of mass</I>, that mass cannot be created or destroyed -- now combined by <a href="separat.htm">Einstein</a> with the principle of the conservation of energy, so that mass and energy can turn into each other, but cannot be absolutely created or destroyed.

<P><blockquote>"But it has surely been decided, as it must be, to leave alone the one way as unthinkable and nameless (for it is no true way), and that the other is real and true.  How could what is thereafter perish? and how could it come into being?  For if it comes to be, it <I>is</I> not, and likewise if it is <I>going</I> to be.  So coming into being is extinguished and perishing unimaginable.</blockquote>

<P>It is often thought, reasonably enough (e.g. by <a href="hegel.htm">Hegel</a>) that "becoming" splits the difference between Being and Not Being, since something that is becoming already participates in what it is to be.  Parmenides, however, rejects this utterly, since whatever something is supposed to be becoming, it <B>isn't</B> that thing <I>yet</I>, an especially harsh difficulty when we are talking about non-existence becoming existence.

<P><blockquote>"Nor is it divisible, since it is all alike;</a> nor is there more here and less there, which would prevent it from cleaving together, but it is all full (<img src="images/greek/empleon.gif" align=middle>, <I>&eacute;mpleon</I>)</blockquote>

<P>Being is a <I>plenum</I> (the Latin translation of the Greek word), i.e. it is <I>full</I> of Being, since any emptiness or any lack of density could only be due to the disallowed Not Being.

<P><blockquote>"of what is.  So it is all continuous; for what is clings close to what is.  But, motionless within the limits of mighty bonds, it is without beginning or end, since coming into being and perishing have been driven far away, cast out by true belief.  Abiding the same in the same place it rests by itself, and so abides firm where it is;</blockquote>

<P>It cannot go anywhere, since only Not Being could be there before Being arrived, and only Not Being could be left after Being had gone elsewhere.

<P><blockquote>"for strong Necessity holds it firm within the bonds of the limit that keeps it back on every side, because it is not lawful that what is should be unlimited; for it is not lacking -- what is not would lack everything.  But since there is a furthest limit, it is bounded on every side, like the bulk of a well rounded sphere, from the center equally balanced in every direction;</blockquote>

<P>Being is not infinite, and this seems to be the only point that does not really follow from Parmenides's argument -- he can only say it is not "lawful."  He is just more comfortable with a limited One, like a big beach ball.  A follower of Parmenides, <B>Melissos of Samos</B>, more consistently argued that Being was infinite.

<P><blockquote>"for it cannot be somewhat more here or somewhat less there.  For neither is there that which is not, which might stop it from meeting its like, nor can what is be more here and less there than what is, since it is all inviolable; for being equal to itself on every side, it rests uniformly within its limits."</blockquote>

<P>The <I>Way of Truth</I> poem is then followed by the <I>Way of Seeming</I>, in which Parmenides describes the world <I>as though</I> there really was dualism.  This concession, however, posed no radical challenge to  the received tradition of Greek philosophy.

<P><a name="notbeing"><img src="images/parmen.gif" align=right>The argument of Parmenides against Not Being was a challenge left to subsequent philosophy.  What is to be made of it?  Parmenides seems to rule out the reality of the "real" world.  In the subsequent history of philosophy, roughly three things were done to make sense of the theory:

<P><ol>
<li>The One was interpreted to be <B>matter</B>.  This was the approach of the "Atomists," like <B>Democritus</B>, and of <B>Empedocles</B>.  The Atomists allowed that Not Being existed as much as Being, which allowed fragements of Being, i.e. "atoms," to move around in empty space and be different shapes and sizes.  This accounted for the character and interactions of matter -- and for the motto, "Atoms and the Void," to account for all of reality.  "Atom" itself, <img src="images/greek/atomos.gif" align=middle>, <I>&aacute;tomos</I> (plural <img src="images/greek/atomoi.gif" align=middle>, <I>&aacute;tomoi</I>), means "uncut, indivisible" (from <img src="images/greek/cut.gif" align=middle>, <I>t&eacute;mn&ocirc;</I>, "to cut" -- as in <img src="images/greek/hysterek.gif" align=middle>, <I>hysterektom&iacute;a</I>, "hysterectomy," to cut out [<img src="images/greek/out.gif" align=middle>, <I>ek</I>] the <img src="images/greek/womb.gif" align=middle>, <I>hystera</I>, uterus -- something Greek surgery never dared to do), because the Atomists thought they were the smallest things, each like a little One of Parmenides.  This was not modern atomic theory, although the atoms of modern <a href="atoms.htm">chemical elements</a> cannot be divided without losing their elemental identity.  Cutting atoms results in <a href="particle.htm">subatomic particles</a>.  Empedocles, in turn, proposed that there were <a href="elements.htm">four elements</a>, which is what became popular and dominant through the Middle Ages.  This interpretation of Being as matter came first and the most easily "saved" the world of perception.

<P><li>The One was generally later interpreted to be <B>God</B> -- a <I>theistic</I> interpretation.  Because of this Parmenides tended to be associated with the earlier philosopher <B>Xenophanes</B>, who seems to have been a monotheist.  The <a href="hist-1.htm#late">Neoplatonists</a> simply called God "the One," and in <a href="hist-1.htm#high">mediaeval</a> theology, when the question arose why God was uncreated and indestructible, arguments much like those of Parmenides could be used.  As an interpretation of Parmenides, however, this doesn't look very good, since the One is without life or personality -- it is inert.  And finally,

<P><li>Plato replaced the One with his theory of <I>Forms</I> -- <I>e&iacute;d&ecirc;</I>, <img src="images/greek/eide-w.gif" align=middle> (singular <I>e&icirc;dos</I>, <img src="images/greek/eidosw.gif" align=middle> -- a term appropriated by Aristotle and translated <I>species</I> in Latin) or <I>id&eacute;ai</I>, <img src="images/greek/ideai-w.gif" align=middle> (singular <I>id&eacute;a</I>, <img src="images/greek/idea-w.gif" align=middle> -- whitch Aristotle used exclusively to characterize Plato's theory).  The Forms (most philosophers said "Ideas" until recently) are like the One in being eternal and unchanging, but unlike the One in being many.  Although Parmenides would have had a real problem with this, Plato of all subsequent Western philosophers took the most seriously Parmenides' rejection of the existence of the world of appearances.  Although unpopular in the West, however, this world-denying view is quite common in <a href="history.htm#india">Indian philosophy</a>.

<H3 ALIGN="center">Note on Parmenides,<br>On Patronymics</H3>

<p><center><img src="images/key.gif"></center>

<P>It is noteworthy that the <I>name</I> <img src="images/greek/parmenid.gif" align=middle>, "Parmenides," has two parts, "Parmen" and "-ides."  "-Ides" is a suffix which makes a <I>patronymic</I>, that is, it marks the name of a son's father.  "Parmenides" thus means "son of Parmen."  This is common in many languages, but is especially famous in Russian.  "Son of Parmen" in Russian would be "Parmen<B>evich</B>," <img src="images/greek/parmnvic.gif" align=middle>.  "Daughter of Parmen" in Russian would be "Parmen<B>ovna</B>," <img src="images/greek/parmnovn.gif" align=middle>.  Other languages, however, do the same thing.  "Son of Parmen" in Persian would be "Parmen<B>z&acirc;deh</B>," <img src="images/greek/parmnzad.gif" align=middle>.  There are now many <a href="iran.htm#iran">Persian</a> surnames with the "-z&acirc;deh" suffix, which literally means "born."

<P>In Russian, we find the name "Basil," <img src="images/greek/vasilii.gif" align=middle>, "Vasilii," derived from Greek <img src="images/greek/basil.gif" align=middle>, "Basileios."  The Patronymic is then <img src="images/greek/vasilvic.gif" align=middle>, "Vasilevich."  "Daughter of Basil" is <img src="images/greek/vasilevn.gif" align=middle>, "Vasilevna," or 
<img src="images/greek/vasilovn.gif" align=middle>, "Vasilovna."  In the Middle Ages, the Greek letter <I>beta</I> came to be pronounced "v," which carries over into Russian, which is why "Vasilii" looks like it is written with a "b."

<P>Variations in Greek patronymics can be examined with the <a href="romania.htm#christname">Christian name</a> "John," <img src="images/greek/john.gif" align=middle> (see discussion of "John" <a href="romania.htm#john2">here</a>).  We expect that patronymic to be <img src="images/greek/johnides.gif" align=middle>, "<B>I&ocirc;ann&iacute;d&ecirc;s</B>," which does occur.  In Modern Greek, we also see this as <img src="images/greek/johnidis.gif" align=middle>, "I&ocirc;ann&iacute;dis."  But in Modern Greek, we also see something very different, namely <img src="images/greek/johnopol.gif" align=middle>, "<B>Yiann&oacute;poulos</B>," with some variations.  In this we have an entirely new patronymic ending, "-opoulos," which occurs in the Middle Ages but is really of unknown derivation.  The actual "John" part of this name looks a lot like "John" in Italian, the variant "Gianni" of "Giovanni."  "Gianni" is pronounced a whole lot like "Johnny" in English.  In Greek, however, the letter <I>gamma</I> in this position has become a "y," as I have transcribed it.

<P><B><img src="images/greek/sh6.gif">&acirc;hz&acirc;deh</B>, <img src="images/greek/shahzade.gif" align=middle>, "Son of the King," was a Persian term (Turkish <I><img src="images/greek/sh4.gif" align=middle>ehzade</I>) used in India as the title, <B><img src="images/greek/sh6.gif">&acirc;hz&acirc;da</B>, <img src="images/greek/shahzada.gif" align=middle>, of the son and heir apparent of the <a href="sangoku.htm#moghuls">Moghul Emperors</a> (who did write it in the Arabic alphabet).  It was thus used like "Prince of Wales" in <a href="perifran.htm#wales">Britain</a> or "Dauphin" in <a href="lorraine.htm#dauphine">France</a>.  We also see the name <B><img src="images/greek/sh6.gif">ahr&acirc;z&acirc;d</B>, <img src="images/greek/shahrzad.gif" align=middle> -- Scheherazade from the <a href="islam.htm#abbas"><I>Thousand and One Nights</I></a>, whose name at first looks like it means "city born."  Her sister was <B>Duny&acirc;z&acirc;d</B>, <img src="images/greek/dunyazad.gif" align=middle>, which looks like "world born."

<P><center><img src="images/key.gif"></center>

<P>This makes me suspicious, since "world," <a href="buddhism.htm#note"><img src="images/greek/dunya.gif" align=middle border=0></a>, here doesn't make much sense.  We might expect "Duny&acirc;z&acirc;d" to contrast with "<img src="images/greek/sh7.gif">ahr&acirc;z&acirc;d" as meaning "country born" as against "city born."  The root does look to be Arabic, where I see no senses of "country" in it, although the basic meanings are "near, close, lowly, mean, earth, temporal, secular," etc.  It is conceivable that "country" or "rural" could have been in that mix, especially when we consider that "rural" in Latin, <I>paganus</I>, has certain negative implications, consistent with "lowly" or "mean."  On the other hand, perhaps the problem is back with "Shahr&acirc;z&acirc;d."  <B><img src="images/greek/sh6.gif">ahr</B>, <img src="images/greek/shahr.gif" align=middle>, is "city" in Persian; but we also get the same word in Arabic, where <I><img src="images/greek/sh2.gif">ahr</I>, <img src="images/greek/shahr.gif" align=middle>, actually means "new moon" or "month."  But the root, <I><img src="images/greek/sh2.gif">ahara</I>, <img src="images/greek/shahara.gif" align=middle>, is the beginning of a variety of meanings, "to make well-known, famous, renowned, notorious."  Wikipedia say that "Shahr&acirc;z&acirc;d" means "noble born," which isn't quite the same thing, but it would contrast nicely with "Duny&acirc;z&acirc;d" as "lowly" or "meanly born."  Since the women are sisters, we could account for the difference between "noble" or "renowed" and "lowly" in terms of their mothers.  But the status of children at this time generally derives from their fathers.  So this business remains more than a little puzzling.

<P><center><img src="images/key.gif"></center>

<P>In Hindi, with Arabic <I>h.ar&acirc;m</I>, <img src="images/greek/haraam.gif" align=middle>, "<a href="newotto.htm">forbidden</a>," we get <I>har&acirc;mz&acirc;da</I>, <img src="images/greek/haramzad.gif" align=middle>, "son of the forbidden, bastard."  Note the diacritic on <a href="cognates.htm#sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> "j" for "z," which is a <a href="upan.htm#note-0">sound</a> imported from Persian.

<P>Even English and Spanish have patronymics, though now, as in Persian, they have simply become surnames.  Thus, "son of John" was "John<B>son</B>," now a very common surname (including two Presidents of the United States).  In Spanish, patronymics are marked by "-ez" (Portuguese, or sometimes in Spanish, "-es").  "I&ntilde;iguez" is "son of I&ntilde;igo."  "Velasqu<B>ez</B>" (or "Vasqu<B>ez</B>") is "son of Velasco," a name, like I&ntilde;igo, of <a href="flanders.htm#gascony">Basque</a> origin -- also like the names Sancho and S&aacute;nchez, Garcia and Garc&eacute;s, all of which figure as names of the Basque <a href="perifran.htm#spain">Kings of Navarra</a> and <a href="flanders.htm#gascony">Dukes of Gascony</a>.

<P>So English and Spanish patryonymic equivalents of "Parmenides" would be "Parmenson" and "Parme&ntilde;ez," respectively.  "Son of John" in Spanish is actually <B>Iba&ntilde;ez</B>, using a form of "John" that looks like that name, <img src="images/greek/ivan.gif" align=middle>, <B>Ivan</B>, in Russian (which gets us the patronymics "Ivanovich" and "Ivanovna").  A melancholy instance of this Spanish name can be found with Father Florencio Iba&ntilde;ez, who is buried in the floor of the ruined church of the isolated and wind-swept <a href="ross/ross-8.htm#soledad">Mission Soledad</a> in the Salinas Valley of <a href="ross/calif.htm">California</a>.  In <a href="perifran.htm#modnor">Iceland</a>, patronymics are used instead of surnames, with "-son" and "-dottir" suffixes used for sons and daughters, respectively.

<P>Patronymics (or "filiations") in Latin use the word <I>filius</I>, "son," following the name of the father.  Julius Caesar was thus also <I>Gaii filius</I>, "son of Gaius."  In daughter languages of Latin the derivative of <I>filius</I> may come first.  Thus we see the name of the mathematician <a href="hist-1.htm#bacon">Fibonacci</a>, short for <I>Filius Bonacci</I>, "son of Bonaccus."  From Norman French we get names in English like <B>Fitzroy</B>, i.e. <I>filius regis</I>, the "son of the king," of used for illegitimate sons of a king, as with a natural son of King <a href="flanders.htm#monmouth">Charles II</a>, Henry Fitzroy.

<P><B>Matronymics</B>, where people are named after their mothers also occur.  We see this a lot in the <a href="gita.htm#bharat"><I>Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata</I></a>.  The heroic elder, <B>Bishma</B>, <img src="images/greek/bhishma.gif" align=middle>, is the son of the goddess of the Ganges River and so is <B>Gang&acirc;putra</B>, <img src="images/greek/gangputr.gif" align=middle>, where "son," <I>putra</I>, <img src="images/greek/son3.gif" align=middle>, is added as a suffix, as in English.  Otherwise, we get a dedicated form.  Thus, each of the P&acirc;ndavas, known as such as the sons of Pandu, was also a <B>Kaunteya</B>, <img src="images/greek/kaunteya.gif" align=middle>, or a son of their mother <B>Kunt&icirc;</B>, <img src="images/greek/kunti.gif" align=middle> -- where we get a suffix and an <a href="system.htm#ablaut">Ablaut</a> of the internal vowel.  It turned out that the tragic figure Karna was also a <img src="images/greek/kaunteya.gif" align=middle>.

<P>While not exactly matronymics, Spanish names have traditionally consisted of two surnames, one from the father, the other from the mother.  This is unlikely to have derived from Arab or Isl&acirc;mic sources, or from elsewhere in Europe.  At the same time, surnames were an innovation in the Middle Ages, so it is possible that the Spanish custom was autochthonous.  We might also wonder if this, like some other features of Spanish tradition, derived from the Basques.  In any case, it can be very confusing for people not familiar with the Spanish usage.

<P><img src="images/maps/assyria2.gif" align=right>The political event that still cast its shadow in the early days of Greek philosophy was the fall of the Assyrian Empire.  Reduced to a small heartland by the Aramaean migrations in the 11th century, Assyria suddenly had reasserted itself under Adadnir&acirc;ri II and Ashurnasirpal II.  With most of the Levant and Mesopotamia taken up with small states, there was little to stand in the way of an organized, energized, and aggressive Assyria; and in short order it became the dominant power in the Middle East.<br clear=right>

<P>This dominance lasted slightly less than 300 years, going into overdrive under the <B>Sargonids</B> in the last century.  The kings used the title <I>Sh&acirc;r-sh&acirc;rrim</I> -- <img src="images/hiero/bab-king.gif" align=middle>, "king," <I>sh&acirc;r</I> in Akkadian, <I>lugal</I> in Sumerian -- "King of Kings," which we have seen since the days of <a href="notes/oldking.htm#sumer">Akkad</a>; but their aspirations to universal rule, well served by the unprecedented extent of their conquests, foundered on the scale of the brutality and terror of their methods.  Assyrian policy was to deal with rebellion by exemplary executions and forced relocations.  By some estimates, over four million people were deported.  The removal of the <a href="ross/calif.htm#sequoia">Cherokee Nation</a> to Oklahoma in American history, called the "Trail of Tears," not to mention the deportation of <a href="turkia.htm#note-2">Armenians</a> from Turkey, may give some sense of what this would have been like.

<P><a name="ten">The deportation of the Ten Tribes of <a href="notes/newking.htm#israel">Israel</a> (by Shalmaneser V or Sargon II after the fall of Samaria in 722) is recounted with striking specificity in the Bible:

<P><blockquote>[2 Kings 18:11] The king of Assyria carried the Israelites away to Assyria, and put them in Halah, and on the Habor, the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.</blockquote>

<P>The "Habor" is certainly the Habur River, which arises between the Tigris and Eurphrates and flows south into the Euphrates.  This was an area otherwise demographically overwhelmed by the Aramaeans.  Despite this information about where the Tribes had gone, they nevertheless disappear from history.  The Bible has Sennacherib saying, "Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, destroying them utterly" [2 Kings 19:11], and King Hezekiah of <a href="notes/newking.htm#israel">Judah</a> says to God, "the kings of Assyria have laid waste the nations and their lands" [19:17].  The Bible makes is sound like Jerusalem was only saved by an "angel of the Lord," perhaps the plague, slaying "a hundred and eighy-five thousand in the camp of the Assyrians" [19:35].  However, Jerusalem had already been spared by the payment of tribute; and other sources, including Herodotus, place the deaths in the Assyrian army at Pelusium, obviously staging to invade Egypt.  The Assyrian army retreated, for the time being.  This did not stop Sennacherib from later showing the Jews the army had captured at Lachish executed by impalement in the art of his palace.

<P>Such policies culminated in Ashurbanipal's assault on and massacre of the Elamites.  <img src="images/maps/assyria.gif" align=left>This <I>sounds</I> like a genocide, since the Elamites shortly thereafter disappeared from history altogether.  However, although Ashurbanipal himself boasted that no Elamites were left, we know from Babylonian records that there actually were.  And while Susa and its environs may have been depopulated, Elam stretched out to the East beyond the reach of Assyria.  There the Elamites seem to have been assimilated with the Persians, who styled themselves rulers of an Elamite kingdom, Anshan, who used the Elamite language in inscriptions and some records, and who then make Susa one of their capitals.

<P>Thus, while these sorts of actions sustained a vast empire for more than a century, subject peoples were never reconciled to Assyrian rule, and the constant campaigns of defense and punishment ultimately exhausted the Assyrians, even though they had tried to assimilate conquered and imported Aramaeans (and Israelites?) into their own population and army.  The fall of the Assyrian empire came with surprising suddenness.  The Medes and the Babylonians, who cooperated in defeating Assyria, divided the Asiatic domain of the Assyrians between them.  Egypt had meanwhile liberated itself.  Nineveh disappeared in ruins, the remaining Assyrian populace was lost among the Aramaean population, and the works and literature of Assyrian civilization ceased.

With the Medes, we have the first appearance of an <a href="cognates.htm#sanskrit">Iranian</a> state in the full light of history.  Previously, the evidence of Iranian presence on the plateau behind the Zagros Mountains has been indirect and ambiguous.  The expectation is that Iranians may have been there shortly after 2000 BC, but we don't have anything definite until we find the horse culture and Vedic gods of the Kingdom of the <a href="notes/newking.htm#mitanni">Mitanni</a> (c.1530-c.1330).  The appearance of the Mitanni is roughly simultaneous with the intrusion of Indo-Aryan invaders in the <a href="upan.htm#steppe">Indus Valley</a>.  In both cases, we see the introduction of the <B>horse</B>, which had been missing from the earlier civilizations of Mesopotamia, India, and Egypt.  Thus, to the <a href="notes/oldking.htm#sumer">Sumerians</a>, the horse was the <img src="images/hiero/bab-ass.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/bab-lan2.gif" align=middle><img src="images/hiero/bab-ra.gif" align=middle>, <I>anshe-kur-ra</I>, the "ass of [foreign] countries."  However, the demographic basis of the Mitanni was not Iranians, but <B>Hurrians</B>, one of the non-Semitic and non-Indo-European <a href="armenia.htm#languages">peoples</a> of the ancient Middle East.  The theory for long was that Iranians represented a small warrior aristocracy among the Hurrians, as they also did among the <a href="notes/newking.htm#babylon">Kassites</a>.  It is now questioned whether there were such warrior aristocracies at all, but the Iranian influence, whatever its form, is still obvious.  What is curious is that we must then wait another 600 some years before an organized Iranian state appears.<br clear=right>

The days of the last Dynasty of Babylon leave a melancholy impression.  This is the last flourishing of the great Mesopotamian civilization founded by Sumer and Akkad.  And it is an impressive effort, as we can see from the still substantial ruins of Nebuchadnezzar's Babylon -- ruins that unfortunately already existed as such to make a similarly melanchology impression on the Roman Emperor <a href="romania.htm#flavian">Trajan</a>, who examined them on the march in 117 AD.  The rulers of this Neo-Babylonian Kingdom, however, don't seem to be from the original Babylonian population.  They are said to be "<B>Chaldeans</B>," and this has traditionally been interpreted to mean one of the Aramaean groups that had been present in Mesopotamia for some time and whose language was already replacing the ancient Akkadian languages of Assyria and Babylon.  The evidence for this Aramaean identification is thin, and some scholars now doubt it; but it is not at all clear who the Chaldeans would otherwise have been.  There is not some <I>other</I> large demographic presence that we are aware of after the Aramaeans.

<P>The daughter of the Median king Cyaxares was married to Nebuchadnezzar, the son of King Nabopolassar.  We hear that the famous result of this were the <B>Hanging Gardens of Babylon</B>, built to assuage the homesickness of the bride for the mountains of Iran.  Later this was identified as one of the <a href="hist-1.htm#wonders">Seven Wonders of the World</a>.  However, nothing that looks like the Gardens, or their necessary foundations, has been found by archaeologists at Babylon. And questions have been raised how plants could have been placed on terraces that were necessarily built of mud-brick, when water and roots would have destroyed them -- even with the waterproofing that we know the Babylonians did using bitumen.  So some scholars have wondered whether the Gardens even existed.  Nevertheless, Greek travelers report seeing them, unfortunately without any information on their precise location, construction, or layout.  So we are left with a bit of a mystery.

<P>Nebuchadnezzar perpetuated one Assyrian practice by deporting subjects to populate the city of Babylon.  The Babylonian Captivity of the Jews, after he took Jerusalem in 587, is the most famous example of that.  However, the Babylonian attitude was a bit different from the Assyrian, and the Jews in Exile did not lose their identity and disappear from history, as had the Ten Tribes deported by the Assyrians.  Far from it.  Babylon became a center of Jewish life, and it continued to be one ever after Cyrus allowed the Jews who wished to return to Palestine and rebuild the Temple.  Indeed, the Babylonian Jewish community, although subsequently shifting to later capitals like Ctesiphon and Baghdad, continued to flourish well into the Middle Ages.  It looks like original Hebrew text of the Bible was first set to paper in Babylon, and the classic form of the <a href="calendar.htm#jewish">Jewish Calendar</a> was formulated (much later) by the Babylonian community in Baghdad.<br clear=right>

<P>The Medes expanded their domain at the expense of Anatolian kingdoms, culminating in the Battle of the Eclipse on 28 May 585 BC with the Lydians.  <img src="images/maps/neo-bab.gif" align=right>The eclipse (first contact, 18h 10m local time; maximum eclipse, 90% total, 19h 02m, just before sunset; last contact 19h 52m, after sunset), supposedly predicted by the philosopher <a href="#why">Thales</a>, ended the battle and the war.  The balance of power between Media, Babylonian, Lydia, and Egypt was generally maintained until a new king came to the throne of Persia, a vassal of Media, in 559.

Lydia entering the scene of Great Power conflict brings Western Anatolia back on the stage of history, for the first time since the fall of the <a href="./notes/newking.htm#hittite">Hittites</a>.  <a href="cognates.htm"><img src="images/greek/anatolia.gif" align=right border=0></a>Lydia itself has a long legendary history, supposedly dating back to Heracles, but it is not dateable until the time of <a href="plato.htm#gyges">Gyges</a>.  Lydia holds a place of importance in world history second to none simply for having invented the coinage of <a href="socrates.htm#socrates">money</a>.  This will be good or bad depending on one's estimation of the benefits of such a medium of exchange.  There is no true reason for doubt of its essential contribution to the growth of wealth and material human progress, but it is not difficult to find both <a href="trade.htm">ancient</a> and <a href="marx.htm">modern</a> idealogy that is hostile to commercial culture, economic freedom, and the general abundance that attend them.

All of its reported kings are named <B>Midas</B> and <B>Gordios</B>.  Which is which in the legends is a good question.  With one Midas, however, we get the story of the "Midas Touch," that the king wished for, and received, the power to turn anything to gold by touching it.  Unfortunately, this was an unconditional power, and there was no way he could touch anything, even food or family, without turning them to gold.  So it was a power that would grieve and then starve him.  With some Gordios we have a more historical account.  The king is supposed to have woven an gigantic knot, attended with the prophecy that the man who could undo it would conquer the world.  When <a href="hist-1.htm#great">Alexander the Great</a> arrived, beheld the knot, and was told of the prophecy, he simply drew his sword and cut the knot.  Alexander did, more or less, conquer the world, and we are left with an expression, "cutting the knot," which is probably used most often without awareness of its origin.  The knot, however, may not be named after an eponymous king, but after the capital of Phrygia, <B>Gordion</B> (Gordium).  This was not far west of Angora, the capital of <a href="hist-1.htm#galatia">Galatia</a>.  Galatia was founded by Celts who invaded Greece in 279 and entered Anatolia by 278.  Most of Phrygia was overrun in this invasion/migration and so came to be overlain by Galatia.

<a href="notes/oldking.htm"><img src="notes/sedgebee.gif" align=right border=0></a>The system of <B>Thirty Dynasties</B> for the history of Ancient Egypt was formulated by the Egyptian priest <a href="hist-1.htm#manetho">Maneth&ocirc; of Sebennytus</a>, writing in Greek under the <a href="hist-1.htm#text-9">Ptolemies</a>.  The Persians, who overthrew the XXVI Dynasty in 525, were reckoned by Maneth&ocirc; as the XXVII Dynasty.  Sometimes the last Persian rulers of Egypt (Artaxerxes III, etc.) are called the "XXXI Dynasty" (lasting only thirteen years).  This proposal is an ancient one, handed down by the Christian Chronographer Julius Africanus.

<P><img src="history/power-e8.gif" align=right>Sometimes the Ptolemies are now called the "XXXII Dynasty," or the Macedonians the "XXXII" and the Ptolemies the "XXXIII," but these are modern, indeed quite recent, suggestions.  Following along, the Roman Emperors who ruled Egypt, starting with <a href="romania.htm#julio">Augustus</a>, can be the "XXXIV" Dynasty, something I have just seen.  Since many of those Emperors wrote their names in Egyptian on Egyptian temples, the device is reasonable enough.  The practice, however, fades away; and no attempt has been made to continue Egyptian dynastic numbering through Roman ruling houses or periods.<br clear=right>

<P>The XXVI Dynasty, of <img src="images/hiero/sais.gif" align=middle>, Sais (<img src="images/greek/sais.gif" align=middle>), represents the greatest flowering of the Egyptian state and civilization since the <a href="notes/newking.htm#chron">New Kingdom</a>.  Sadly, it was also the last hurrah of Ancient Egypt.  The Saite Kings, who largely feature the names <img src="images/hiero/psamtik.gif" align=middle> and <img src="images/hiero/neko.gif" align=middle>, almost seem aware of that themselves.  They carried out probably the first official exploration of the pyramids, copying the Old Kingdom art they discovered and introducing their own burials into tombs that were already two thousand years old or more, including that of <a href="notes/oldking.htm#3">Djoser</a> at Saqqara, whose deep gallaries must have been both frightening and fascinating.

<P><img src="notes/twolady.gif" align=right>In March 2017, the remains of a colossal statue of Psamtik I were discovered in Cairo, at the site of what was known as a temple of Ramesses II in Heliopolis.  This was an impressive product from any period, standing some 36 feet tall and consisting of quartzite, an immensely hard stone that was never used by the Egyptians more than sparingly.  At first this was assumed to be an image of Ramesses II, but Psamtik's name was then discovered clearly, and originally, incised on the back.  This rather stunned Egyptologists, since it seemed to bespeak power, wealth, and technical mastery such as previously had not been associated with the XXVI Dynasty.  It was the largest royal statue since at least the XX Dynasty.  There was no reason <I>not</I> to believe that Egypt was wealthy and powerful at this time, but few were not surprised that the Saite Kings could exercise their power in this way.

<P>The antiquarian project of the XXVI Dynasty, and its other works, are then found together with the first hints of the <a href="hist-1.htm">Hellenistic Age</a>, since the reliance of the Saite Kings on Greek mercenary soldiers and the significant presence of Greek <a href="#why">traders</a> in Egypt launches a Greek presence that soon enough becomes dominant, contributing much of the terminology, and many of the names, that we use for Ancient Egypt.  This may have been a factor in the overthrow of Apri&ecirc;s, <img src="images/hiero/apries.gif" align=middle> (Herodotus, <img src="images/greek/apries2.gif" align=middle>; Hebrew <img src="images/greek/apries1.gif" align=middle>; Maneth&ocirc;, <img src="images/greek/apries.gif" align=middle>; Septuagint <img src="images/greek/apries3.gif" align=middle>), by Ah.mose II, <img src="images/hiero/ahmose.gif" align=middle>.  Apri&ecirc;s became unpopular, first by, as Herodotus says [II:161], sending Egyptian troups deliberately to be slaughtered against Cyrene, to increase his power in Egypt, which can only mean that people suspected a plot to give greater prominence for his Greek mercenaries.  This may mean that he was seen as being too closely associated with the Greeks -- the Egyptians didn't like foreigners very much, and the Greeks were often contemptuous of the Egyptians.

<P>Apies sent Ah.mose to quell the rebellion, but, of course, he joined the rebels.  Then Ah.mose dealt with the problem of the Greeks by directing the foundation of Naucratis, <img src="images/greek/naucrati.gif" align=middle>, opposite Sais on the Canopic Branch of the Nile, as the emporium and colony for all the Greeks in Egypt.  That succeeds admirably, and Egypt continued to draw on Greek help all through the history of the Persian empire.  Ah.mose, in practical terms, was no more anti-Greek than any earlier Kings.

<P>The discovery of the statue of Psamtik I also reminded Egyptologists of the similarities of early Greek art to that of Egypt.  It has long been noted that the early Greek <img src="images/greek/kouros.gif" align=middle> male figures and the <img src="images/greek/kore.gif" align=middle> female figures look very Egyptian.  Now, the statue of Psamtik highlights its <I>own</I> similarity to the <img src="images/greek/kouros.gif" align=middle>, leading to speculation that it was <I>this statue</I>, or perhaps similar (undiscovered) ones elsewhere, that became the model for the corresponding Greek products.  Without the testimony of a Greek sculptor, this must remain speculation; but there is no doubt that Egyptian models must have existed, and been seen by Greeks, for the transmission of the style to have occurred.

<P>A curious feature of the names of the Kings in Greek is that, rather than simple numbering for the same names, Maneth&ocirc; gives us distinct names for Psamtik I, <img src="images/greek/psamtik1.gif" align=middle>, Psamtik II, <img src="images/greek/psamtik2.gif" align=middle>, and Psamtik III, <img src="images/greek/psamtik3.gif" align=middle>.  On the other hand, with Neko, we actually get a word for "second," i.e. Neko I, <img src="images/greek/neko.gif" align=middle>, and Neko II, <img src="images/greek/neko.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/second-m.gif" align=middle>.  I've never seen any discussion or explanation for this.  However, Kings often insert extra formulae into their names, like <img src="images/hiero/loveamon.gif" align=middle>, "Loved of Amon," which was as true for the Saite Kings as any, and so Maneth&ocirc; may have been using some of those for his transcriptions, to distinguish the Kings.  This is not unusual in the rest of his history.

<B>Cyrus the Great</B> overthrew, in turn, the Medes, Lydians, and Babylonians, suddenly creating an empire far larger than even the Assyrian.  Cyrus was better able, through more benign policies, to reconcile his subjects to Persian rule; and the longevity of his empire was one result.  The Persian king, like the Assyrian, was also "king of kings," <I>x<img src="images/greek/sh2.gif">ayathiya x<img src="images/greek/sh2.gif">ayathiy&acirc;n&acirc;m</I> (<I>sh&acirc;hansh&acirc;h</I> in modern Persian) -- "great king," <img src="images/greek/great-m.gif" align=middle> <img src="images/greek/basileus.gif" align=middle>, <I>megas basileus</I>, as known by the Greeks.

Be that as it may, it led to a bit of a succession crisis.  The winner, <B>Darius</B>, based his claim on membership in a collateral line of the <a href="javascript:popup('history/achaemen.gif','achaemenids','resizable,scrollbars,width=325,height=1001')" onMouseover="window.status='Click for image popup of Achaemenid genealogy';return true" onMouseout="window.status='';return true">Achaemenid</a> Dynasty.

<H2><a name="text-3"><I>Zoroastrianism</I></H2>

<P>There is not really any evidence for the validity of this claim, but one alternative is even more intriguing.  Darius gives the name of his father as "Visht&acirc;spa."  Now, the patron and protector of the <B>Prophet Zoroaster</B> (c.628-551 BC) was named "Visht&acirc;spa," leaving us to wonder if these are in fact the same individual.  It may be impossible to ever say for certain, but a good indication may be that it was Darius who introduces Zoroaster's religion, or some version of it, into the Persian State.  Darius invokes the One God of Zoroaster, <B>Ahura Mazd&acirc;h</B>, the "Wise Lord," in his trilingual inscription at Behistun, which describes how he came to the Throne [<a href="#note-23">note</a>].  His very name, although of obscure etymology, may be a Zoroastrian one, "Sustainer of Good [Thought]," invoking one of the "Archangels" or "Bounteous Immorals" (<B>Am<img src="images/greek/shwa.gif"><img src="images/greek/sh.gif">a Sp<img src="images/greek/shwa.gif">ntas</B>) of Zoroastrianism.

<P>The teaching of Zoroaster contained some unique features.  It was a monotheism but also posited a dualism of Good and Evil, with an entity representing evil, <B>Angra Mainyu</B>, or "Evil Mind," who was the cosmic Enemy of God, or at least of <B>Sp<img src="images/greek/shwa.gif">nta Mainyu</B>, "Holy Spirit."  This introduced a supernatural and apocalyptic conflict of Good and Evil into religion, with Angra Mainyu marking the perhaps the first appearance of a Satan-like figure who eternally opposes God and the Good.  Human beings must choose between Good and Evil.  Zoroastrianism itself is the "Good Religion."  This is why <a href="nietzsch.htm">Nietzsche</a> uses Zoroaster in his <I>Also Sprach Zarathustra</I>, giving him the chance to go "beyond" good and evil and renounce the conflict that he initiated.

<P>It is possible that the Zoroastrian moralization of religion, which may for the first time overcome the <a href="#morally">moral ambivalence</a> of myth, is what produced a similar revolution in <a href="notes/newking.htm#israel">Judaism</a> and in <a href="#why">Greek philosophy</a>.  Greek philosophers, beginning with <B>Xenophanes</B>, who express a moral critique of Greek religion, are certainly subsequent to the nearby presence of Persian religion, while with Judaism, the Babylonian Captivity and then the liberation of the exiles by Cyrus, opens the possibility of major Persian influence, certainly in the Jewish community that remained in Babylon after the Persian conquest -- the very place, apparently, where the Bible was compiled and committed to writing.  This has long been a matter of speculation, but at this point there probably will never be a way of definitively settling the question of such Zoroastrian influence.  In later Zoroastrianism, monotheism seems to be compromised by making Ahura Mazd&acirc;h (<B>Ohrmazd</B> in <a href="iran.htm#shahs">Middle Persian</a>) and Angra Mainyu (<B>Ahriman</B>) co-eternal, but this was only true <I>a parte ante</I>, i.e. into the past, and never <I>a parte post</I>, i.e. into the future.  In the Zoroastrian Apocalypse -- which may be the first such conception in religion -- only Good survives.  Hell and Angra Mainyu are destroyed, and all damned souls purified.

<P><a name="elements"><img src="history/achaemen.gif" align=left>Another area where Zoroastrian influence is possible or likely on Judaism concerns the system of the <B>Am<img src="images/greek/shwa.gif"><img src="images/greek/sh.gif">a Sp<img src="images/greek/shwa.gif">ntas</B>, the "Bounteous Immortals."  There is considerable debate about exactly what these are, or what their relationship is to Ahura Mazd&acirc;h, but they have long been recognized as perhaps the archetypes of the <I>angels</I> we then see in Judaism, and later Christianity and Islam:  &nbsp;Hebrew <img src="images/greek/angel-h.gif" align=middle>, <I>mal'&acirc;kh</I>, "messenger," as is <img src="images/greek/angel-g.gif" align=middle>, <I>angelos</I>, in Greek, and <img src="images/greek/angel-a1.gif" align=middle>, <I>malak</I>, or <img src="images/greek/angel-a2.gif" align=middle>, <I>mal'ak</I>, in Arabic -- plural <img src="images/greek/angel-ap.gif" align=middle>, <I>mal&acirc;'ikah</I> -- which now gets confused with the root for "king," <img src="images/greek/malik.gif" align=middle>, <I>malik</I>, which is quite different.  They certainly represent various salient attributes of God, but they are created and function as independent beings apart from God.  They almost approach being independent deities, and compromising Zoroastrian monotheism; but then the other monotheisms have no difficulty conceiving of angelic entities functioning apart from God.

<P>In Achaemenid Zoroastrianism, however, the monotheism is certainly compromised by the surival or revival of traditional deities, such as the god <B>Mi<img src="images/greek/theta.gif">ra</B> and the goddess <B>Anahita</B>.  The history of some of these is striking, particularly in the case of Mi<img src="images/greek/theta2.gif">ra, who certainly corresponds to the <B>Mitra</B> of the <a href="gods.htm#note-0">Vedas</a>.  His future career in the West, however, will be the most remarkable.  Thus, we find his name as an element in the names of native kings in Anatolia during the <a href="hist-1.htm">Hellenistic Age</a>, most notably with multiple Kings of <a href="hist-1.htm#pontus">Pontus</a> named <img src="images/greek/mithrada.gif" align=middle>, <B>Mithridates</B>, "given by Mi<img src="images/greek/theta2.gif">ra" (<img src="images/greek/mehrdad.gif" align=middle>, <I>Mehrd&acirc;d</I> in Modern Persian).  Mithridates VI fought three wars with <a href="rome.htm">Rome</a>.  But then the cult of <B>Mithras</B> enters Rome itself, to join the group of Mystery Religions that transform the Roman religious landscape.  Eventually, soon <a href="romania.htm#tetrarch">before</a> the triumph of Christianity, Mithras was identified with <I>Sol Invictus</I>, the "Unconquered Sun" which had become the center of the Roman State Cult.  The birthday of Mithras, December 25th, was taken over by the new religion.

<P>On the genealogical diagram, we see that <a href="hist-1.htm#great">Alexander the Great's</a> illegitimate son, Heracles, who was murdered in 309, was actually a descendant of Artaxerxes II.  We see Greek mercenaries, like Mentor and Memnon, married to Barsine, great granddaughter of Artaxerxes, and Alexander's admiral, Nearchus, married to her daughter.  Heracles was the only claimant to Alexander's throne who had Persian royal blood, which, with his illegitimacy, may have told against him.

<P><img src="images/4element.gif" align=right border=0>A noteworthy feature of the system of the Zoroastrian Immortals is their association with particular natural elements.  Thus, we see Fire, Earth, and Water, which look like the original <a href="elements.htm#india">Indian</a> elements of the <I>Ch&acirc;ndogya Upanis.ad</I>.  However, unlike subsequent development in India, we do not get Air or Aether (<img src="images/greek/sanskrt7.gif">).  Instead, first of all we get Metal and Plants.  This looks parallel to the Metal and Wood which are traditional <a href="elements.htm#china">Chinese</a> elements in addition to Fire, Earth, and Water.  Since influence from distance China seems unlikely in this period, Zoroastrian Metal and Plants would seem to be an original and autochthonous, albeit parallel, version of a theory of elements.  The sixth element, however, associated with Good Thought, is different in kind.  "Cattle" are not "elements" in the sense we get otherwise of the common constituents of matter.  It is an "element" of things in a different sense.  As such, it curiously parallels something we get in the movie <I>The Fifth Element</I> [1997, Bruce Willis, Milla Jovovich], where the "fifth element" to the familiar <a href="elements.htm">Greek</a> Earth, Air, Fire, and Water is actually an entity, a being (played by Jovovich), who focuses the other four.  This is not unlike the role of Cattle in Zoroastrianism (albeit passive rather than active), which form the focus of innocent life that must be protected by Righteousness.

The name of the Immortal <B>X<img src="images/greek/sh.gif">a<img src="images/greek/theta.gif">ra</B>, "Dominion," is a cognate to the word for the warrior class in the Hindu <a href="caste.htm">Caste System</a>, the <B>Kshatriyas</B>, <img src="images/greek/varna-2.gif" align=middle>.  It also looks like an element in the Persian names of the Achaemenid Kings named "Xerxes" and "Artaxerxes," making them names, like "Darius," probably inspired by Zoroastrianism.

<P>"Zoroaster," of course, is the Prophet's name from Greek, <img src="images/greek/zoroastr.gif" align=middle>.  The language used in the <B><I>Avesta</I></B> or <I>Zend Avesta</I>, the sacred book of Zoroastrianism, is now called "Avestan."  The <I>Avesta</I> first appeared in a European language in a French translation by <B>Abraham Hyacinthe Anquetil-Du Perron</B> (1731-1805), who, with some difficulty (war and personal conflicts complicating things) obtained a copy in India and, with the help of local Parsis, mediated a translation by way of their Persian, published in 1771.  Avestan is a dialect, cognate, or older version of Old Persian, and it is the <a href="cognates.htm#sanskrit">Iranian</a> language the closest to Sanskrit.  William Jones, at first disbelieving the text that Du Perron had published, later realized, after learning Sanskrit, that it was for real.  Du Perron's 1801/02 Latin translation (with Greek articles!) of selected <a href="upan.htm#upan">Upanishads</a> was the book that alerted <a href="arthur.htm">Schopenhauer</a> to the value of Indian philosophy.  The oldest part of the <I>Avesta</I>, in the oldest version of Avestan, are the <B>G&acirc;<img src="images/greek/theta.gif">&acirc;s</B>, the texts which seem to be Zoroaster's own revelations.

<P>Zoroaster's name in the <I>Avesta</I>, transcribed phonetically, was <B>Zara<img src="images/greek/theta.gif">u<img src="images/greek/sh.gif">tra</B>, with the /z/ as in English, the <img src="images/greek/theta.gif"> in as English "thin," and <img src="images/greek/sh.gif"> as English "sh."   <a href="nietzsch.htm">Nietzsche's</a> German form <I>Zarathustra</I> would actually get the /sh/ right (in the "st" combination = /sht/), but it would have German /ts/ for "z" and /t/ for the "th."  After the Achaeminids, Zoroastrianism would be eclipsed during the Hellenistic Age, as Greek kingdoms and then the Hellenophile <a href="iran.htm#parthian">Parthians</a> ruled Ir&acirc;n.  The religion reemerged, in a deliberate and militant form, under the <a href="iran.htm#shahs">Sassanids</a>.<br clear=right>

<P>Macedonia quietly grew into a power that, under Philip II, would dominate Greece and, in short order, turn against Persia.  It is a little odd to think of all these monarchs, so important in Greek history, as not actually being Greek; but, like neighboring <a href="hist-1.htm#epirus">Epirus</a>, they are not.  A revealing point in this respect is the epithet <img src="images/greek/philhell.gif" align=middle>, "Philhellene," of Alexander I.  No Greek needs to be called "loving the Greeks."  Exactly what the linguistic affinities of the Macedonians were is unclear.  That it could be to the later Illyrians, or Thracians, or even modern <a href="turkia.htm#zog">Albanians</a>, is always possible, but the matter is largely speculative.  Whatever it was, the Philhellenism of the Kings soon created a layer of Greek culture that made them seem proper Greeks to everyone except, of course, the actual Greeks.  The Macedonian monarchy itself also struck the Greeks as rather un-Greek.  When Philip added his own statue to a procession of the Twelve Olympians, his assassination shortly thereafter suggested that the gods had been offended.  If so, his son, Alexander III, was untroubled, initiating Hellenistic practice by assuming divine attributes -- something else to scandalize the Greeks, if by then anyone actually cared.  The modern <a href="turkia.htm#macedon">Macedonians</a> are actually Slavs, but nearly everything about both the ancient and modern peoples is disputed by them and by <a href="turkia.htm#greeks">Modern Greeks</a>.

<P><a name="text-5">Egypt, which was added to the Persian empire by Cyrus's son Cambyses, frequently revolted against the Persians.  The Persian invasion of Greece in 490 was in part to be punishment of the Greeks for helping the Egyptians in these revolts.  Since the invasion of 480 was then in revenge for the failure of the invasion of 490, we could say that the consequences of Greek interference in Egypt were persistent.  But the Egyptians and the Greeks kept at it, and eventually</a>....

A revolt succeeded, and Egypt was independent for sixty years late in the empire.  This was the last time Egypt was actually ruled by Egyptians until King Far&ucirc;k (who was descended from the Albanian <a href="turkia.htm#egypt">Muhammad Ali</a>) was overthrown in 1952.

<P>Little is known about this entire period apart from  the names given by Maneth&ocirc; and references by Greek historians.  The name of the only ruler of the XXVIII Dynasty is not even known from any Egyptian inscriptions.  Only the XXX Dynasty, with two substantial reigns, did any kind of building in the old royal manner.  After the brief restoration of <a href="#31">Persian</a> rule, the next established dynastic government in Egypt was the <a href="hist-1.htm#text-9">Ptolemies</a>.

<H2><a name="sebennyt"><I>Sebennytus</I></H2>

<P>The XXX Dynasty was based at Sebennytus, <img src="images/greek/sebennyt.gif" align=middle>, the only time that city became the capital of Egypt, although it would then otherwise be distinguished as the birthplace of the historian <a href="hist-1.htm#manetho">Maneth&ocirc;</a>, who was himself responsible for the systematization of Egyptian history into thirty dynasties.  So it is suitable that the system should culminate in his own hometown.

<P>The Egyptian name of Sebennytus is intriguing.  Written phonetically, we find <img src="images/hiero/sebennyt.gif" align=middle>.  The first element, read second, is the ideogram of the Egyptian word for "god," <img src="images/hiero/god-e.gif" align=middle>, which, oddly enough, stands behind the modern word for the chemical element <a href="atoms.htm#VA">nitrogen</a>.  The phonetic first element, <B><U>t</U>b</B>, is a root that curiously does not occur in any form in the vocabulary of Gardiner's <a href="egypt.htm"><I>Egyptian Grammar</I></a>.  There are several forms of it, however, in <I>A Concise Dictionary of Middle Egyptian</I>, by Raymond O. Faulkner [Oxford, Griffith Institute, 1962, 1964 -- which surprisingly is hand written and does not use the beautiful hieroglyphic font developed for the Oxford editions of Gardiner's <I>Grammar</I>] and now in the <I>Hieroglyphic Dictionary, A Middle Egyptian Vocabulary</I>, by Bill Petty, PhD [Museum Tours Press, Littleton, Colorado, 2012, 2013, p.175 -- in the modern font].

<P>There are two semantic fields involved, one for "vase," <img src="images/hiero/vase.gif" align=middle>, and the other in which we find words for "sandal," <img src="images/hiero/sandal.gif" align=middle>, "to be shod," <img src="images/hiero/shod.gif" align=middle>, and others (e.g. "sole [of the foot], "sandal maker").  So <B><U>T</U>b-n<U>t</U>r</B> could mean the "vase of the god," or the "sandal of the god," or something else beyond our reckoning.  "Sandal" may be our best bet, although the name of the city, like "vase," lacks any indication of the weak third consonant (a semi-vowel) in the root, such as we see in all the words related to "sandal" (<B><U>t</U>bw</B>).

<P>Other writings of Sebennytus, according to E.A. Wallis Budge, are <img src="images/hiero/sebenny2.gif" align=middle> and 
<img src="images/hiero/sebenny3.gif" align=middle> [<I>An Egyptian Hieroglyphic Dictionary</I>, Volume II, John Murray, London, 1920, Dover Publications, 1978, p.1059].  These include an ideogram for a kid or newborn calf, which is phonetically unrelated to the name (<B>'iw</B> or <B>'ib</B>), and is semantically very different from the <B><U>t</U>b</B> roots.  These forms are unexplained.

<P>The later pronunciation of Sebennytus (the Latin form) is then interesting in its own right.  The Egyptian <a href="egypt.htm">phoneme</a> <B>/<U>t</U>/</B> is reconstructed as the <B>ch</B> in English.  Strikingly, the Coptic name of the city is <img src="images/greek/sebennyc.gif" align=middle>, <B>Djemnouti</B>, where the initial consonant is simply the voiced form of <B><U>t</U></B>, i.e. the Modern English <B>j</B>, written for Egyptian as <B><U>d</U></B> or <B>dj</B>.  This consonant, whatever its voicing, would have defeated the Greeks, which probably is why we see <img src="images/greek/sebennyt.gif" align=middle>, with it reduced to an <B>s</B>.  The presence of <B>b</B>, <B>n</B> and <B>t</B>, however, secure this as a form of the Egyptian name.  We also see the <B>s</B> in the modern Arabic name, which is <img src="images/greek/samannud.gif" align=middle>, <I>Samann&ucirc;d</I>, where the <B>b</B>, rendered as a labial, as in Coptic, and <B>n</B> (doubled as in Greek) survive, with the <B>t</B> now voiced.

<P><img src="images/maps/egypt-27.gif" align=left>The Kings of the XXX Dynasty did a fair amount of building.  Nekhtnebef (Nectanebos I) began the temple of Philae, at Aswan, that later was enlarged by Ptolemies and the Romans, and which many centuries later was the last place where hieroglyphics were still being inscribed.  We see below how Nekhth.areh.be (Nectanebos II) came to the Throne with the help of Agesilaus II of <a href="#sparta">Sparta</a>.  Later he fled before the Persians into <a href="notes/newking.htm#25">Kush</a>.  We do not know how long he then lived, but King Nastasen of Kush may have made an attempt to restore him.  The Kushite must have had no hard feelings over the way that the XXVI Dynasty Kings (perhaps because of <a href="racism.htm">racism</a>, in <I>Egyptians!</I>) had attempted to erase from Egypt the names of all the XXV Dynasty Kings.  Forgive and forget.

<P>The practice of Maneth&ocirc; in the <a href="#26">XXVI Dynasty</a> of giving different names in Greek to Kings who have the same names in Egyptian, is curiously reversed in the XXX Dynasty.  Thus, Maneth&ocirc; gives <img src="images/greek/nectanb1.gif" align=middle> as the first King of Dynasty.  This is <img src="images/hiero/nectanef.gif" align=middle> in Egyptian, according to Kevin L. Johnson and Bill Petty [<I>The Names of the Kings of Egypt</I>, Museum Tours Press, 2012, p.75], although E.A. Wallis Budge gives this as the name of the <I>last</I> King.  Then for the last King, Maneth&ocirc; has <img src="images/greek/nectanb2.gif" align=middle>, which differs from the first name only by the vowel in the nominative ending.  For this, Johnson and Petty have <img src="images/hiero/nectaneb.gif" align=middle>, which differs in particulars from what Budge has for the first King.  Part of the difference involves a prefixed formula about the love of a goddess, whose identity seems to vary with each attestation (here I show Hathor).  Otherwise, there is a common "nkht" element, but the rest of the names are different.  Why Maneth&ocirc; then makes the names so similar is a good question.  The names also seem to both be attested in Greek as <I>Nektaneb&ocirc;</I>, so we also see the Kings listed as "Nectanebo I" and "Nectanebo II."  So the names of the last native Egyptian Kings of Egypt seems to end with some obscurity.<br clear=left>

<P>Sparta, along with all the other strange and horrible characteristics of its constitution, had a peculiar dual monarchy.  Key moments in Greek history are marked by the death of Spartan kings.  Either King could wage war, but the most dramatic events seem to be associated with the dynasty of the Agiads.  The fall of <img src="images/greek/leonidas.gif" align=middle>, <B>Leonidas</B>, to the Persians at Thermopylae (480), with 300 Spartans, is one of the classic moments of world history (his name, in the Doric <a href="archon.htm#dialects">dialect</a>, is a <a href="#note-22">patronymic</a>, "Son of Leon," and would be <img src="images/greek/leonides.gif" align=middle>, <I>Leon&iacute;d&ecirc;s</I>, in Attic Greek).

<P>The death of <B>Cleombrotus</B> at Leuctra (371), surprised by the tactics of the great Theban general <B>Epaminondas</B>, <img src="images/greek/epaminon.gif" align=middle>, is nearly as significant, signaling both the end of Spartan hegemony over Greece and a military revolution.  At Leuctra, Epaminondas used an oblique line, with a reinforced left, opposite the Spartans.  There he placed his best Theban troups in a formation fifty men deep, against which the Spartans only had twelve.   We could call this formation the <img src="images/greek/phalanx.gif" align=middle>, <I>phalanx</I>.  This was the word for any Greek line of battle, but it tends to be used more for the later line of <a href="#macedon">Philip of Macedon</a>, sixteen men deep.  Nevertheless, it was Epaminondas who is going to use this reinforced <I>phalanx</I> to win the battle.  The Theban right and the Spartan left, with unenthuastic allies, hung back and never even engaged.  Epaminondas drove directly at the Spartans and crushed them, with a great slaughter of Spartan citizens, who could not be replaced.

<P>Epaminondas went on to liberate Messinia, which Sparta had long enslaved, and Sparta was reduced to Laconia, in the southeast corner of the Peloponnesus.  This permanently restricted Spartan power.  Epaminondas then died at the Battle of Mantinea (362), ending a career that we might compare to the great <a href="perifran.htm#descartes">Gustavus Adolphus</a>, who fell at L&uuml;tzen (1632) in the <a href="francia.htm#hapsburg-2">Thirty Years War</a>.

<P>The third Spartan King to die in battle, <B>Agis</B> at Megalopolis (331), in an attack on the allies of Macedonia, and an attempt to raise a rebellion against Macedonian hegemony, showed that the Greek states would henceforth be unable to resist the power of the Hellenistic monarchies.  In this case, it was a move against <a href="hist-1.htm#great">Alexander the Great</a> himself, put down by <a href="hist-1.htm#macedon">Antipater</a>, the Regent of Macedon.  Sparta had not acknowledged Macedonian supremacy previously, but as the result of the battle surrendered hostages to Alexander.

<P>I have discussed <a href="#why">elsewhere</a> the favorable attitude towards Sparta of Athenian philosophers like Plato.  We see a complacent regard for Sparta continuing in a contemporary treatment such as the 2007 movie <I>300</I>.  As in other fictionalized treatments of the battle at Thermopylae, this movie overlooks the fact the 300 Spartans did not go alone to the battle.  Spartan citizens fought as heavily armed and armored -- not nearly naked, as in the movie -- <B>hoplites</B>, like Mediaeval knights; and as with such knights, they were accompanied by more lightly armed troops whose presence is often overlooked.  These would have been from among the <I>perioikoi</I> ("dwellers around") and the serf-like Helots, i.e. the non-Spartan residents of Lacedaemonia.  The presence of the terrorized and oppressed non-citizen subjects of Sparta might have made glowing statements about freedom and justice ring a little hollow.  Also, when Leonidas sends most of his force away, the 300 Spartans were not without other company.  The allied Thespian and Theban contingents remained with him -- the latter because he didn't trust them not to go over to the Persians, which is what they did once the Spartans and Thespians were evidently defeated.  The Spartans were not, as it happens, killed with flights of arrows -- which is something that I believe comes from an earlier <I>movie</I> -- but simply fought to the death.  The movie then leaves unmentioned the naval Battle of <a href="apology.htm#salamis">Salamis</a>, where the Persian fleet was defeated and their army left in Greece less able to supply itself -- thereby overlooking the role of the Athenians in the defeat of the Persians.  This postponed further action until the next year, when the Spartans with hosts of Greek allies defeated the Persians on land at the Battle of Plataea.  Indeed, the Spartans never could have made a stand at Thermopylae in the first place without the Athenian fleet.  The movie showed Persian ships sunk in a storm, but not all of them were; and the Persians could easily have sailed troops <I>around</I> Thermopylae if Themistocles had not kept their navy out of the Gulf of Euboea with attacks north of Euboea at Artemisium.  The Athenians were fighting at sea even while the Spartans were fighting on land.  This is a bit like what happened at <a href="history/guadal.htm">Guadalcanal</a>, where the fighting on land draws attention from popular books and movies, while the naval battles, upon which the fate of the campaign turned, are largely ignored.

<P>Such distortions coninued in 2012 on cable television historical documentaries.  One show curiously ignored <I>Thermopylae</I> and jumped directly to the Battle of Plataea, which nevertheless was never actually named.  In this treatment, the Spartans were the ones all eager for battle, and it was the Athenians whose participation was uncertain, until a vote was taken.  This was used to illustrated the existence of the democracy at Athens, but at the same time it served to gloss over and obscure the continuing difficulties of getting the Spartans to fight with their allies against the Persians.  But then the documentary also ignored one of the supreme moments of Spartan piety and fortitude.  As Persian arrows fell among them, the Spartans did not even raise their shields, because the auspicies were not favorable.  The priests sacrificed one animal after another, to examine the entrails, until finally the signs were auspicious.  This illustrates a number of things worth noting.  If the priests had been cynical frauds, as we all know from Protestant and Enlightenment anti-clericalism, it is unlikely that they would have allowed their fellows to be killed and perhaps endangered the whole army and the contest of the day by continually judging the signs to be inauspicious.  The slightest suspicion that the priests were insincere would have drawn considerable wrath.  Instead, we also see how seriously the Greeks took their religion, that the Spartans were willing to endanger their fortunes and lives in the battle rather than fight, or even defend themselves, before the gods indicated the right time.  Since the battle was then a great and decisive victory, no one was going to be disillusioned of their benighted pagan superstitions.

<P><a name="gotell">The fallen Spartans were buried at Thermopylae, and their epitaph, attributed (doubtfully) to Simonides of Ceos, <table cellpadding=5 border align=right bgcolor="#ffffff"><tr><td><center><img src="images/greek-2.gif"></td></tr></table>has remained famous but is now typically mistranslated:  &nbsp;"<B>O Stranger, go tell the Lacedaemonians that here we lie, obedient to their words.</B>"  Not only in the fictionalized movie, but with the academic talking heads in a documentary I saw on the <a href="http://www.history.com/">History Channel</a>, the last word (second to the last in Greek) has been translated "laws" rather than "words."  This is really a grotesquely false rendering.

<P>The word in Greek, <img src="images/greek/rhemasi.gif" align=middle>, <I>rh&ecirc;masi</I>, is the dative plural of <img src="images/greek/rhema.gif" align=middle>, <I>rh&ecirc;ma</I>, which means, according to the authoritative Liddell and Scott <I>Greek-English Lexicon</I> [Oxford, 1889, 1964], "word" or "phrase."  My Greek grammar book, <I>A New Introduction to Greek</I> by Chase and Phillips [Harvard, 1965], gives the meaning as "word" or "command"; but "command," like "laws," seems to be more an interpretation than a translation.  Indeed, although the <I>verb</I> behind <I>rh&ecirc;ma</I> -- <img src="images/greek/ero-say.gif" align=middle>, <I>er&ocirc;</I> -- can mean "to order" as well as "to say" or "tell," a less ambiguous word for "command" would be more like <img src="images/greek/keleuma.gif" align=middle>, <I>k&eacute;leuma</I>.  But "laws"  (<img src="images/greek/nomoi.gif" align=middle>, <I>nomo&iacute;</I>) is really off the semantic map there.  From the same root as <I>rh&ecirc;ma</I> we get <img src="images/greek/rhetor2.gif" align=middle>, <I>rh&ecirc;t&ocirc;r</I>, "speaker," <img src="images/greek/rhetoric.gif" align=middle>, <I>rh&ecirc;tore&iacute;a</I>, "public speaking," and the modern word "rhetoric."  The associations of that even now are not good, as in "empty rhetoric."

<P>The "laws" translation may be particularly inappropriate in that <I>rh&ecirc;masi</I> can have a bit of a <I>bitter edge</I> that is missed in the understanding of many scholars -- i.e. obedience to your <I>words</I> (i.e. empty rhetoric), when your <I>actions</I> have fallen short.  The Spartans were always reluctant to campaign outside the Peloponnesus.  They tended to fear revolts by the Helots as much as any external enemies.  Thus, while Leonidas took some troops far from Sparta, excuses were made that kept most of the army closer to home.  A year later, with the Persians pouring into Central Greece, it was nearly impossible to get the Spartans to send their army as far as Plataea in Boeotia.  The Spartans were content to sit behind the wall they had built at the Isthmus of Corinth.  It wasn't until the Athenians threatened to go over to the Persians and use their fleet to land the Persian army behind the wall that the Spartans decided to honor their obligations to the allies.

<P>I now think I may have found the origin of this "laws" translation.  <table cellpadding=5 border align=right bgcolor="#ffffff"><tr><td><center><img src="images/greek-2.gif"></td></tr></table>The Loeb Classical Library edition of <I>The Greek Anthology</I> looks like one of the original texts with the Simonides quote [Volume II, Books 7-8, Harvard University Press, 1917, pp.138-139] -- I doubt that most historians were reading the inscription off the stone at Thermopylae, if it is still even legible, or still there (I don't know).  The 1917 translation by W.R. Paton runs, "Stranger, bear this message to the Spartans, that we lie here obedient to their laws."  I expect that some scholars may look at this and proceed without any doubts.

<P>As it happens, the Loeb edition of Herodotus [<I>The Persian Wars</I>, Volume III, Books V-VII, Harvard, 1928, 2006, pp.544-545] translates the inscription as, "Go tell the Spartans, thou that passest by,/ That here obedient to their <B>words</B> we lie."  Oh.  The translator, A.D. Godley, has rendered <I>rh&ecirc;masi</I> as "words."  Good work there.

<P><table cellpadding=5 border align=left bgcolor="#ffffff"><tr><td><center><img src="images/greek-2c.gif"></td></tr></table>There is a curious difference in the <I>Greek text</I> between the <I>Greek Anthology</I> quote and the text the way I originally saw it in Chase and Phillips.  They quote the inscription from Herodotus (as shown above), which has <img src="images/greek-2a.gif" align=middle>, while the <I>Anthology</I> text is <img src="images/greek-2b.gif" align=middle>.  <I>Ang&eacute;llein</I> is the infinitive of the verb "to announce, proclaim, report" [Liddell and Scott, p.4], while <I>&aacute;ngeilon</I> is a noun, "messenger, envoy," apparently in the <a href="cognates.htm#note-1">accusative case</a>.  I don't quite understand the grammar of either of these constructions.  The word should be a verb, but I would expect the imperative, or a more polite hortative, rather than the infinitive.  If it is the noun, there is no verb in the main sentence, outside the dependent clause, and the case really should agree with "stranger," which is in the vocative.  So I find both versions a little perplexing.  Perhaps someone whose Greek is better can enlighten me.

<P>Less epochal than Thermopylae but of particular interest is an event of 361.  King Agesilaus II was given a banquet by the King of Egypt -- this was Takh&ocirc;s of the <a href="#sebennytus">XXX Dynasty</a>.  As customary at Egyptian celebrations, the Egyptians wore cones of fat and perfume on their heads.  Agesilaus was so offended by the perfume -- prohibited at Sparta -- that he walked out.  As it happens, Agesilaus was in Egypt with 1000 Spartans as mercenaries for Takh&ocirc;s.  Sparta needed the money, and so they did what Greeks had been doing for three hundred years, working for the King of Egypt.  While Agesilaus and Takh&ocirc;s were off fighting the Persians in Phoenicia, a cousin of Takh&ocirc;s revolted back in Egypt.  Since Agesilaus hadn't been getting along with Takh&ocirc;s, he supported the cousin, who consequently became King Nectanebos II (360), the last Egyptian King of Egypt.  Nectanebos showed his gratitude with a payment of 230 <a href="socrates.htm#socrates">talents</a> to Agesilaus.  The aging Spartan King died before returning to Sparta, after a long reign that saw his city go from the hegemon of Greece, triumphant over Athens, to a second rate power that couldn't even stop Thebes from freeing Messinia.

<P>Sparta maintained its independence into the Hellenistic Period, but it began to lose its distinctive cultural and political character.  Areus I introduced silver coinage, and wealth eroded the old communal and military traditions of the city.  Indeed, wealth and poverty grew together, and the number of Spartan citizens was gravely reduced as many fell below the property qualification.  King Agis IV tried to reverse all this with a program to forgive debts, redistribute land, and recruit new citizens from the <I>perioikoi</I>, the non-citizens who had always lived around Sparta.  Agis forced his royal colleague, Leonidas II, into exile; but then Leonidas returned and killed Agis.  Nevertheless, the son of Leonidas, Cleomenes III, put all of Agis's reforms into effect.  Cleomenes even allowed many Helots, the virtual slaves at the bottom of Spartan society, to buy their freedom.  All this attracted the attention and support of the many of the poor elsewhere in Greece, and Spartan affairs took on larger overtones.  Cleomenes himself was tempted to expand against the <a href="hist-1.htm#leagues">Achaean League</a>, but he was defeated and driven into exile by the Achaeans and <a href="hist-1.htm#macedon">Macedonians</a> (222).  The last Spartan King, Nabis, tried his own version of Cleomenes' social revolution; but Sparta was annexed by Achaea when Nabis was assassinated.

<P>This list is from E.J. Bickerman, <I>Chronology of the Ancient World</I> [Cornell Univesity Press, 1968-1982], p. 126.  Bickerman mentions that "the earliest datable kings are Polydoris and Theopompus (first half of the seventh century).  A reliable list of kings begins with" those shown.

<P>The <B>ahura</B> in "Ahura Mazd&acirc;h" is cognate to <B>asura</B> in <a href="cognates.htm#sanskrit">Sanskrit</a>.  The Sanskrit term was originally for a class of deities, such as Varuna, that were somewhat more remote and fearsome than the <B>devas</B>, who were the gods, like Indra, that were closer to human affairs.  In time, the <B>asuras</B> came to be regarded as enemies of gods and men, i.e. <I>demons</I>, and a great deal of Hindu mythology comes to be concerned with <B>devas</B> or greater deities, such as the devotionalistic <a href="gods.htm">Gods</a>, fighting demons.

<P>In Zoroastrianism, the fate of the terms is very different.  The <B>ahuras</B>, originally a class of deities also, shake down to just one:  &nbsp;Ahura Mazd&acirc;h.  On the other hand, the Iranian equivalent of the <B>devas</B>, the <B>da&ecirc;vas</B>, <I>they</I> are the ones that Zoroaster now regards as demonic.  They are the ones that demand blood sacrifice and other practices that Zoroaster condemns as unclean and evil.

<P>It is noteworthy that the word "demon" itself was similarly innocent in origin.  The <B>daimones</B> in Greek were just "spirits."  In the <a href="apology.htm"><I>Apology</I></a>, Socrates takes it as unproblematic that "spirits" are "gods or the children of gods."  It was Christians who decided that the old pagan spirits were evil.<img src="images/kali.gif" align=right>

<P>There is a curious sequel to the "demonization" of the <B>asuras</B> in India.  The late, Tantric forms of Hinduism and <a href="buddhism.htm#vajra">Buddhism</a> develop "Wrathful" forms of devotionalistic deities, such as the goddess <B>K&acirc;l&icirc;</B>.  These beings are terrifying and violent, bloody and dressed with skulls, but they represent positive divinities and are still fighting <B>asuras</B>.  Also, sometimes kinds of demons play positive roles, as when the hero <B>Bh&icirc;ma</B> of the <a href="gita.htm#bharat"><I>Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata</I></a> fathers a son, Ghatotkacha, by a <B>R&acirc;kshas&icirc;</B>, a kind of female demon -- albeit after killing her brother, who wanted to eat Bh&icirc;ma and his brothers.
