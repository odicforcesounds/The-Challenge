# Life is only a dream

JavaScript and computer technology is all about logic.

Then we split the problem into several pieces.. 

What else is simplicity if not a bunch of other simplicities in sequence, while all of them represent the complexity it self, which is complex if you wish to understand! 

## Rules to organize EVERYTHING 
1. I need to organize all text and mix them together to a better sense of interpretation to each reader / listener / visitor..
2. If Domain is pointer to wiki, I should create more
    - app.odicforcesonds.com (with **World Cleaner Challenge**)
    - art.odicforcesounds.com/ ( no JavaScript )
    - v.odicforcesounds.com/ ( pure JavaScript )
    - blogs.odicforcesounds.com
    - wiki.odicforcesonds.com (mkdocs github default template)
        - I can improve this content using **Hexo**
3. I. need several versions of the same website?
    - Maybe not... while I like to static version
4. My English is not so good, then maybe I should translate all to Portuguese. Therefor text content become better.
5. Youtube content must be extracted and included in site. New domain? ???.odicforcesounds.com .. if website content is in Portuguese, then videos can be included in art.domain (static)
6. The propose of using Angular was to learn JavaScript. I didn't learn any JavaScript but how to include pages in routes. I should improve v.domain, while I can try to build a purejs from scratch. 
    - Extract Youtube Videos IDs (from playlist - organized)
    - Extract Bandcamp Music Tracks IDs (from each album)
    - Images can have their own repository or elsewhere.. 
        - Images repo can have 1 md per file with tags (mkdocs)
    - wrap all into a big big static JS Object{[] , []}
7. Asking Dogs and Cats help (if you feel it in yourself)
    - No parties for them, is only to code a better world for both
    - Looking for Cat CodeCat JS Ninja
    - Looking for Dog CodeDog JS Ninja
