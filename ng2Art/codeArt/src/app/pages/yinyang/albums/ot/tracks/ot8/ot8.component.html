  <p>More than anything, this energy that is around Us is Real!</p>
  <p>The Power of Will, is the key to gain any kind of Power!</p>
  <p>Focus the illusion You wish to, build it in your mind. Test.. Test.. keep testing!</p>
  <p>The Brain have deeper capacities than You think!</p>
  <p>Keep calm: many pass their lifes trying without any results, and others could.</p><br>
  <p>More than anything My expression as OdicforceSounds is the begining of the Star Wars Story</p>
  <p>Some will join the Force to express merit of who he/she is in soceity</p>
  <p>Others shall refuse to join the force... creating another force...</p>
  <p>I dont know who am I in the middle of this Story</p>
  <p>But I do not think I am greener since I am bigger...</p>
  <p>In any case... Dreams are made to be buit...</p>
  <p>if You have the ability to build it</p>
  <p>Remember the lesson: keep traying</p>
  <p>Society have the balance between those who own power of decision</p>
  <p>and those who do not wish to have such power</p>
  <p>Is danger to deal with power</p>
  <p>trust me... if you wish... </p>
