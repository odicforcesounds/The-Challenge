  <p>what is real?</p>
  <p>what is not an interpretation?</p>
  <p>what is fantasy?</p>
  <p>what are illusions?</p>
  <p>what is myth?</p>
  <p>what are memories?</p>
  <p>Lets admit</p>
  <p>We all focus on illusions</p>
  <p>we work on illusions</p>
  <p>we design illusions</p>
  <p>we structure illusions using logic and creativity</p>
  <p>we get deep each illusion so hard</p>
  <p>that we spend a life time on our illusions</p>
  <p>so one day we can create them</p>
  <p>I don't understand any of the specifications of how much complexity can be described in sense of those who don't
    accept a simple expression of an inside interpretation, where all use the same tools to express their own illusion
    of true</p>
  <p>but I know what makes this world what it is</p>
  <p>is because illusions were dreamed not only by singular persons</p>
  <p>but by many.</p>
  <p>Any answer is an inside search and an inside research.</p>
  <p>Logic is good for work</p>
  <p>sensitivity and resonance is good for living.</p>
  <p>Where are you in the moment of telling where others shall start their journey of finding the self?</p>
  <p>There is no absolute truth about how we are</p>
  <p>but a fragment of true about what we had express</p>
  <p>there only one holy true</p>
  <p>humanity have several individual expressions that are them self's</p>
  <p>teaching formulas that hack's others brain</p>
  <p>others illusions</p>
  <p>with new illusions</p>
  <p>with new desires to find a reason to say ( my truth is absolute )</p>
  <p>... well, Even Taoism can be expressed in several fragmnets of simplicity</p>
  <p>which will result is a mix of several complexities that are expressions of simplicity as well.</p>
  <p>The more You know the more You think You need to go deep</p>
  <p>while You know You should accept simplicity!</p>
  <br><br>
  <p>Is good You know... </p>
  <p>is about this dream</p>
  <p>that in many billions of cases are consider madness..</p>
  <p>people are crazy.. oh he/she see things I cannot..</p>
  <p>well, that is a skill of creativity to express their illusions..</p>
  <p>are they crazy or they develop a reality we cannot see because we are not paying attention?</p>
  <p>Well, it is an obsessive loop</p>
  <p>while most of the professionals who try to cure are in a obsessive loop to test and "pray" to find a positive
    result</p>
  <p>which in most of the cases, didnt find a cure, but a way to stop the obsessive brain activity which care that
    illusion..</p>
  <p>Well.. While this people have not the desire to punish people or create them impositions of behaviors</p>
  <p>they are fine..they are not crazy at all.. they can learn and get better </p>
  <p>well, even when we live in a system that needs to "impose" rules</p>
  <p> which are as well, illusions.. ( necessary illusions )</p>
