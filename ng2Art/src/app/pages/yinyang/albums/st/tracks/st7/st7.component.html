  <p>Nationality</p>
  <p>Pride</p>
  <p>Both illusions ( that are part of the necessary illusions of any country )</p>
  <p>are Good and Less good to the global conscience of society</p>
  <p>Is natural we all born in some place in this planet</p>
  <p>Is natural we all born with family characteristics, called this days DNA</p>
  <p>There is no reason to believe that my country is better than Yours</p>
  <p>There is no reason to believe that my friends are better than Yours</p>
  <p>There is no reason to believe that any difference between man or woman is better because they are different</p>
  <p>And naturally</p>
  <p>There is no reason to give our lifes in the name of any orden who evaluate it self, as better than other</p>
  <p>There is no reason to believe I am superior to any other living being</p>
  <p>Even if I believe that Birds dont have conscient of their acts</p>
  <p>I am not superior to any Bird</p> <br>
  <p>Education - Respect - Care - Knowledge - Nature - Divine - God</p>
