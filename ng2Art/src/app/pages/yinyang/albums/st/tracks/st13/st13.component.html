  <p>I am not Pagan, but I am not Anything else</p>
  <p>in the aspect of objecting the way my brain think or express</p>
  <p>And I didnt celebrate any purification in my life</p>
  <p>Something I remember my self as a child who talk to dogs</p>
  <p>cats, stones, flowers, birds, cars, the sky with or without Gods</p>
  <p>I talk to my self many times, I do things to my self!</p>
  <p>Like many billions of billions of any human living beings!</p>
  <p>While I personally believe birds and dogs and cats do the same</p>
  <p>because if stones cannot do something for them selfs</p>
  <p>time which include space and an expression of existence, do!</p>
  <p>Maybe I am Logic</p>
  <p>Maybe Theist people are Logic</p>
  <p>Maybe for that reason they accept any expression of any God</p>
  <p>Then it should be logic they are Pagan</p>
  <p>Well, even the Sun as Star is the Unique Relations</p>
  <p>Between Our Temporal Existence which include the planet</p>
  <p>And our temporal condition, which needs the Sun.</p>
  <p>I accept the Sun as a Function to create conditions</p>
  <p>Functions can be Divine in the aspect of their expression</p>
  <p>In the case of Our Galactic Star</p>
  <p>I do not have any doubt of its Divine Functionality</p>
  <p>While We dont really need to Sun to survive</p>
  <p>the Sun is our Main condition to have an Expression of Existence</p>
  <p>Which in a romantic way of thinking using logic, the Sun is Divine!</p>
  <p>Who care if we are Pagan or Atheist?</p>
  <p>What We all should care is if We Love</p>
