  <p>Security Aims to Break Functionality</p>]
    <p>while Functionality aims to dynamizide security</p>
    <p>The More society and Goverments use Security to give Functionality</p>
    <p>The far away they are from getting positive results</p>
    <p>The closer they are from have instalibity</p>
    <p>but wait</p>
    <p>Even Functionality Need security</p>
    <p>well, Sadly but true, we still need security</p>
    <p>but most of the times we dont</p>
    <p>If society pay attention to their population needs</p>
    <p>Security is useless, because most of their population dont need to create instability</p>
    <p>Naturally there are many levels of security that are need to control</p>
    <p>sadly is to control business, not always quality</p>
    <p>For Example: Monsanto...</p>
    <p>We dont need to manipulate any organic aliments</p>
    <p>If everyone can produce them in better conditions</p>
    <p>Even believing that we are billions and Your industry is killing all piece of lands</p>
    <p>Well, but we could go even deeper and talk about Water... </p>
    <p>NoDAPL? Standing Rock?</p>
    <p>India?</p>
    <p>Possessing the Right to give Water to who Ever we Wish is not a Good solution!</p>
    <p>There is water for everyone if You care to Share!</p>
    <p>Sometimes I think security always give problems</p>
    <p>and is true, even in Software developing</p>
    <p>Even for the software in cause that we are applying security rules</p>
    <p>Even that software with any security rules are not secure</p>
    <p>But they should if intention to create instability didnt exist</p>
    <p>Well, is what we have...</p>
    <p>So I am trying to create a solution to give security based on functionality</p>
    <p>because, we put almost all the time, our singularity in the first place</p>
    <p>WE need Balance so the conditions of this Operating System Called Earth</p>
    <p>Dont have the need to create instability!</p>
    <p>instability always come from fragile conditions</p>
    <p>like I am... </p>
    <p>which in my case, I could create a war because Sacrad Territory was touched</p>
    <p>and kill billions, because most everyone dont give a shit about others conditions</p>
    <p>so why should I ?</p>
    <p>Well, I am sorry, You will need to suffer more..</p>
    <p>I am a monkey... I dont always have an intention to destroy</p>
    <p>I use my brain You know?</p>
