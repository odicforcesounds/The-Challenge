  <p> Because between most everything we can feel it depends on sound and image,</p>
  <p>the use of some drugs make us see it with our own eyes</p>
  <p>what normally people can't</p>
  <p>Only light sensitive people who are part of the positive results </p>
  <p>of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odic_force" target="_blank">Odic force</a> phenomena</p>
  <p>that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Reichenbach" target="_blank">Von Reichenbach</a> was trying to
    prove his existence.</p>
  <p>Science... Oh Science</p>
  <p>I am not so good In Math or Logic!</p>
  <p>I am not giving my time to learn it, as I accept it, because is logic!</p>
  <p>Logic?</p>
  <p>I ask Science: Is Life Logic?</p>
  <p>I ask Science: Does Zodiacts are Logic?</p>
  <p>I ask Science: Does Spirituality are Logic?</p>
  <p>I ask Science: What is Logic?</p>
  <p>Our interpretation of Reality, which means, what is our Expression? </p>
  <p>Our interpretation of Creativity, which means, what we think we are?</p>
  <p>Our interpretation of Logic, which are the choices We do?</p>
  <p>Our exponentional imagination, which is the brain activity</p>
  <p>which is the brain expression, the expression of information</p>
  <p>the expression of choices?</p>
  <p>Choices which create, science!</p>
  <p>...</p>
  <p>The challenge between Science and Spirituality</p>
  <p>are in between</p>
