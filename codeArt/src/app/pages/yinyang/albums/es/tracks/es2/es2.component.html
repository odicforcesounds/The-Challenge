    <h5>Just Another Open Door</h5>
    <p>I am the Gate Keeper, the Portal and the Path</p>
    <p>Pay attention, You may find new doors open...</p>
    <p>Do You wish to come with me? </p>
    <p>Stay where You are and read, and feel so You learn!</p>
    <p>Doors can open or close.</p>
    <p>Do You know what doors give You?</p>
    <p>Experience, while You gave Your Self to it.</p>
    <p>I am a door, while You are a door as well.</p>
    <p>I talk to my self, while you read, I talk to You.</p>
    <p>Decisions are not always the best, while is only me or You.</p>
    <p>Making wrong decisions can lead us to learn, but is not logic that it will.</p>
    <p>Making good decisions can lead us to be secure, but is not logic to be secure.</p>
    <p>Security is needed, as information to care decisions.</p>
    <p>Limits are needed, as decisions which care information.</p>
    <p>Pay attention to your decisions, they are not part of your expressions.</p>
